#post{{\*excuse my English, it's not my first language\*

It's been 14 days and I haven't mindlessly scrolled or binge watched content on social media or the internet. To give you some background, my screen time was anywhere between 6-9 hours a day! And most of it was spend on YouTube, especially in the evening and night after work hours.

What did I do?

\*edit\* Thanks to u/DrakenKor who reminded me that none of the following would have happened if I hadn't **#tech-review-motivations{{figured out my WHY}}.** Why this was important and why I had to change.

My compulsive use of technology started when I was a 10. Playing #a-t-games{{games}} on my computer and gaming console, turned into watching TV for hours, which then turned into hours on Orkut, then #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}} and then came my phone. Over the past couple of years I realized that this behavior stemmed from childhood neglect, trauma and years of isolation and anxiety.

Things started to get serious as I entered adulthood. I had extreme social anxiety and I preferred being at home consuming content after content doing nothing. #symp-worse-work{{This in turn effected my career}} and #symp-worse-social-life{{relationships}}. I had enough of it 14 days ago and I haven't looked back. I realized how I have have lost days/weeks/months and years of my life to this! I had to change. I HAD TO. And then, I took the following steps :

1- First, I **changed my phone into a Minimalist phone** \- no app icons and no colors on your home screen and apps drawer . I downloaded an app called "#tech-app{{Minimalist phone" (for android, sorry I do not have an alternative for iphone users) and it changed my home screen into a light phone. Black and white display, can pin only 2 important apps onto the home screen and the rest is just a list of names of the apps that you have.}} I love it. I use my phone in #tech-grayscale{{greyscale}} for added benefit.

2- Second, I **quit all social media (including #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}}), entertainment apps (Netflix, Hotstar) and refrained from using google** as much as possible. #tech-delete{{Deleted all the apps off my phone}}, and learnt to use my phone as a tool not as a source of entertainment. The #withdrawal-time{{first few days were awful}}! #withdrawal-bored{{I felt restless and extremely bored}}. I had nothing to do. I almost slipped into a rabbit hole again but I realized that, I need to **#tech-do-other-things{{replace this habit with positive ones}}.**

* #other-activities-read{{So, I starting **reading**}} : I wasn't even able to complete 1 book this year, as much as I wanted to or tried. And then when I started reading, I finally completed the book I had picked up and put down multiple times in the past 6 months! Without all the distractions and overstimulation, #ben-better-attention{{I could finally focus and concentrate better.}}
* #other-activities-offline-games{{Next, I bought a **sudoku book -**}} I had the app and I enjoyed solving the same on it but I wanted to stay way from my phone so I just bought the book instead. And when I tell you, I can spend 1-2 hours a day solving sudoku puzzles, I'm not kidding. I'm a beginner so it takes me time to solve certain ones lol. Time goes by so quick and I love it!
* #other-activities-art{{Another hobby that I rekindled with, is **painting -**}} Though I enjoyed painting, I hadn't painted in years. Thanks to the addictive nature of social media, the internet and my own mental health struggles, I drifted away from it. Until these past couple of weeks wherein I've completed 2 paintings and I cannot describe how I feel during and post completing one. I'm just glad that I'm finally starting to paint again.

3- #ben-better-handling-negative-emotions{{**Being comfortable with boredom**}}. I know, scary. And it is, you do not have anything to detract you or suppress your thoughts anymore. Your mind is constantly chattering. I feel that initially the chattering is overwhelming, because you're not used to it. As the days go by, you get used to it and learn to observe your thoughts rather than reacting to them immediately. And sometimes you may even get some really good ideas doing the same.

4- I **did not go cold turkey with entertainment or YouTube**. I ate breakfast and lunch mindfully and during dinner, watched 1 epi of my fav sitcom. Only one. That's it. I did not lure myself into thinking "Just one more". Nope. One, and done. As for YouTube, I used Google's "video" section to watch a couple of videos for recipes, and information on a few topics of interest. This way I was not distracted with the suggestions news feed and got what I wanted. Be careful with this one. I would suggest only start doing this a few days after abstaining from the same to avoid slipping. I also visited this subreddit on alternate days for 5-10 mins to get motivated.

5- #tech-meditative-activities{{**Movement, mindfulness and nature**.}} I'm not going to get into the why you should do the following since it's already been talked about a lot. Going out for a walk, stretching, 15-30 min exercise, grounding (walking barefoot in the grass or sitting surrounded by nature), meditation, listening to music, and playing my singing bowl. Instilling these alternatively throughout the week or multiple times a week really helped me with my compulsive urges.

6- #other-activities-learn{{**Learning something new**.}} Be it through reading a book, an article or the news (I prefer reading than watching - 10 mins a day is ideal for me). Also, listening to podcasts on topics that interested me like Psychology, ADHD, Neuroscience, Neuroplasticity etc. Be careful with this one too. Do not bombard your brain with too much information thinking you're being productive and learning something new. 1 podcast a day or 1 article a day is fine. I learnt this the hard way, I listened to multiple podcasts or articles a day and paired it up with reading a book and it made me feel really groggy!

Have been implementing the above in my life consistently, and now my screen time is is down to less than 2-3 hours a day! Most of my time is spent on Whatsapp, talking to my significant other and friends, work related or reading an article.

So ya.. honestly, find what works best for you. Choose interests and hobbies that you enjoy and may have drifted apart from. Observe how you are feeling throughout the day. After each activity, notice did it drain/overstimulate you or enrich you. If you feel drained just sit in silence or lay down with your eyes closed from time to time.

It may take a few trial and errors. You may fail, and you may feel that nothing is working out. Don't be discouraged. Be proud of yourself for even trying to want to change and try something different the next time.

#title:{{30 days of "Dopamine Detox" - My experience}} #permalink:/r/nosurf/comments/wav64x/30_days_of_dopamine_detox_my_experience/, #created:1659069109 

#post{{Pheww! It's been 30 days..

Here's the link to Part 1 - [My story and the things that I implemented](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/vx954c/comment/ifyn4ds/?context=3)

I cannot believe I've made it this far. I've tried getting away from my phone and social media for a long time. I would stick to it for a day or 2 and then boom! back to square one. It became a vicious cycle. I would try for a day or 2, fall back to 6-9 or even 10 hours of screen time. Feel guilty, disappointed and shame that I can't get my life together, and this would then give me more reasons to stick to my phone.

But this time, I had enough. I was at my lowest. I had to bring a change or I would be losing my life to the internet.

I would lie if I said this was easy. NOPE! Far from easy. When you've been dependent on your phone/social media all your life, taking that dependence away is going to hurt that inner child. Like, you're taking away a pacifier. That's exactly how it felt.

#ben-better-handling-negative-emotions{{I also had to face my fears head on.}} Now that I stopped running (distracting/numbing myself), I had no option but to turn, and face the things that I had been running away from all my life. And damn was that overwhelming! I had to constantly remind myself that I may not see the results instantly but to enjoy the process instead. The results will follow.

My biggest take aways -

1. #ben-less-anxiety{{I'm a lot calmer}} - 30 days back #symp-worse-concentration{{I literally felt like a zombie. Brain fog}}, #symp-anxiety{{anxiety}}, #symp-irritable{{irritated}}, #symp-worse-concentration{{I couldn't think straight or form a complete sentence without zoning out.}} But now, I feel a lot calmer. Though I still have anxiety, I'm able to cope with it better.
2. #ben-better-decisions{{Making better decision}} - since my brain is less stimulated now, it is able to make better decisions. If I would have urges to surf or check my social media, I would take a step back and analyze my need to do so. Am I feeling lonely, anxiety, angry, overwhelmed or bored? And then I would do something that would make me feel better. A bath, walk, paint, listen to music, talk to a friend etc.
3. Less anxious - I'm able to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. I've also started therapy so that has helped too.
4. JOMO - Have I missed out on something? Maybe. Memes, and trends are here to stay. I usually get to know about memes or trends that are worth talking about from my friends or partner. So I'm okay with that. I really don't miss it. I actually enjoy not being a part of it anymore. To be constantly updated on what's the new trend.. nah that's exhausting for me. I'm better off in my bed reading a book.
5. #ben-better-connection{{Reconnecting with friends}} - I still have to work on this one. I have isolated myself so much from my friends lately that it has been difficult to reconnect. Though I have made efforts here an there which I am proud of, I still have a long way to go.
6. #ben-appreciate-more{{Joy of little thing}} - I can finally find joy in the little things now. I don't crave instant gratification anymore (sometimes I do). #other-activities-read{{Reading}}, #other-activities-walk{{going out on a walk}}, #other-activities-art{{painting}}, #other-activities-being{{making a cup of tea}}, #other-activities-work{{working on my career}}, #other-activities-learn{{studying}}, #other-activities-being{{listening to the birds sing}}, #other-activities-being{{watching the rain, and just being}}. All feel so gratifying. #ben-feel-more-alive{{I haven't felt this alive in a long time.}}

So, this is it. There is no formula to get your life together, it's a mindset. I'm really proud of myself for coming this far. And I plan on continuing to live this way. And I hope my experience inspires you to do the same.}}
