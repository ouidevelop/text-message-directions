#post{{Hello fellow internet haters.Well I guess that was a pretty good stretch . Let me tell you, it’s true. You do get your old mind back and #ben-feel-better{{it does feel good that’s for sure}} . #other-activities{{I read about 15 books}}, #ben-contemplation{{more time for just contemplation}} , and it may sound strange to you but being able to take a shit in peace was very nice . Now I’m back in the phone game, mostly for work reasons. It’s not so bad but also yes it’s really a terrible thing that we have these things permanently attached to us now. God send us a sun flare please. I recommend the book called #book{{Feed}} to you all.}}
