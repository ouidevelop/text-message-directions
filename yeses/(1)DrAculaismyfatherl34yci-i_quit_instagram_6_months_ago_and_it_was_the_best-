#post{{Hey everyone! This is my first time posting so please go easy on me.

I quit all social media 6 months ago, primarily #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}}. My departure was prompted by an increasingly busy schedule that demanded more time as well as my own concerns about my mental health. I never really used Facebook, Snapchat, or Twitter and still have my accounts, but I haven’t logged in since quitting. Instagram was my bane.

**Why did I quit?**

I would spend 2-3 hours surfing mindless crap daily, and then would sulk about how #symp-comparing{{my life seemingly didn’t compare to those whom I followed}}. It made the most sense as a busy medical student to start here when trying to free up my schedule. In terms of mental health, I went to a top 10 university and am less well off than 90% of my friends from college. In turn, I would see them travel to so many cool places that I could never afford at this point in my life. I’m happy for them, but I would always juxtapose their lives to my own. This led to sulking and nihilistic thoughts like “what’s the point in doing X when my life will still suck after I finish?” It’s a horribly toxic mindset that can create a #symp-feel-bad{{cycle of pessimism}} and #symp-less-productive{{laziness}}. Quick shoutout to this reddit group, since #tech-success-post-reading{{I read a similar post to my own a while back that convinced me to give quitting a serious try}}.

**How was it quitting?**

The #withdrawal-time{{first 2 weeks sucked}}. It’s quitting a bad habit, but this was noticeably one of the harder habits I’ve had to drop. #withdrawal-misc{{I felt a hole in my life. I had more time, but nothing to fill it with}}, #withdrawal-misc-social{{I missed being able to contact my friends so easily}}, and #withdrawal-misc-social{{I missed being out of the loop}}. However, as time went on, things got better, and quickly too. By 2 months in I had no doubts about my decision, and the thought of going back made me laugh.

**What changed that made me happy?**

I filled my free time by #other-activities{{working out}}, #other-activities{{reading}}, and #other-activities{{focusing on research}} and other activities. Funny enough, this solved my worries about being out of the loop since I would read many newspapers, local and large. #ben-better-work{{I was promoted in my activities at lightning speeds thanks to my newfound time and energy}}. I don’t want to give specifics, but the amount of responsibility I have has replaced any thoughts of self doubt with self importance. If I die tomorrow, people will scramble to fill my shoes and the impact will be felt for months purely from a work standpoint. #ben-more-self-esteem{{I feel important. I am important.}}

The last thing is staying in contact with friends. Before I quit I made sure the friends I cared about had my cell number and email. We text or talk every few weeks, #ben-better-connection{{but now we actually have substance to our conversations}}. Instead of saying “Oh yea, I saw you did that cool thing on Insta, must’ve been nice.” I get to say “What have you been up to? Oh yea? Tell me all about it!” And it just piques my interest in their lives and strengthens our friendship.

**Hey man, I’m thinking about quitting, what do you recommend I do to ease the transition?**

Hit up your friends before you dip and give them your personal contact information. Have a plan to fill your time before you quit. This is my biggest regret and it led to me downloading instagram after 10 days before deleting it promptly. It felt like cheating, and I won’t forget the guilt I felt doing that. Find hobbies, try something new! I started doing this thing where #other-activities{{I’d cook one new meal a week}}, and I feel like such an adult it’s great. #ben-in-control{{I feel in complete control of my life and mental health}} again for the first time since I was a kid. #ben-feel-better{{I’ve never been so happy to wake up at 6am and go about my day}}. I actually jump out of bed in the mornings.

This isn’t for everyone, but it’s **shocking** the effects of quitting instagram have had on me. It’s ~~almost~~ pathetic how much of a hold that cesspool had on me. Fuck that app. And now they have a retail menu? I probably would’ve wasted a good amount of money on even more disappointment had I not left. I implore everyone to try taking a break for 6 weeks. Just see if you can do it! It’s a great way to test yourself and gauge your mental strength.

Sorry this was kind of long, but I think it says something that my first post is about this instead of anything else (the MCAT, research, volunteering, clinicals, etc.). Quitting instagram was the best decision I made in 2020, and that’s saying A LOT. Try it out!}}
