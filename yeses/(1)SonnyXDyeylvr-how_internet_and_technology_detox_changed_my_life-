#post{{The last 2 years my life has been a rollercoaster. I've probably experienced all of the emotions that probably exist hahaha, jk of course. But it has been an interesting journey so far from which I learned A LOT

And one of the most important things that I've learned throughout these last 2 years is that social media sucks ass. Until last months or so I've been seeing it like a normal thing, not considering all of the side effects that it offers. I couldn't see them as I was getting cheap dopamine that made me "happy" or fulfilled on the short term

Until I've realized that everyone is on their phone when they go out, everyone is so excited to post a new insta story and show others how their life is, everyone is so careful to not lose the snapchat streak, everyone is posting their photos at different timings so they get the most likes that they can, so they can feel socially accepted in our sick society, everyone is living in this lie which is called social media

So I just said "it's time to stop", and that's what I did. I swear to God, #ben-productive{{I've never been this productive in my entire life}}. I'm currently working on my dream business and things are growing slowly, no-fap has been an awesome thing since #ben-better-social-life{{I'm more socially active}}, no more gaming (was a #a-t-games{{gaming}} addict until last year), social media detox worked like a charm and it was the key to achieving this state!

Here are the steps that I took in this exact order:

# 1. If you're a gamer, stop playing video games

Yeah, sounds TOO HARD, I know.. and this tells you a guy who's been playing games from day 1 lol. I honestly couldn't imagine a life without video games, but came to the conclusion that they don't matter at all. Alright yeah, you're radiant on Valorant or even in top 1% in all-time league of legends players. Does it matter? Of course, it's a nice accomplishment and not everyone can reach that level, but at the end of the day, does it matter? Take a minute and think about this

The reason I'm telling you to cut off games is because you'll eventually reach a point where you won't feel the need or the urge to play games. And it's not about cutting them off forever because that's not the point. The point is the detox that all of us need.. heck, I even play a game from time to time, even considered buying a playstation 2 just for the good old days and I afford to play games again because I know I won't get addicted again, or develop a schedule of playing "x hours" per day (which is really toxic as we are wasting our most valuable resource, time!!!)

# 2. Put in the work, even when you don't feel to

All of us have something to do, even if we're employed, students or business owners. I know you don't feel like studying for that exam which is most likely useless for your upcoming life, but do it. Just do it, because I promise you that after you do this a couple of times, the next times the process will be shorter, easier and you'll love seeing different results. The same applies to us who are already working. Don't feel like doing the task now? Hell na bro, get to work right now and finish it! Leave the rest of the day for your special activities and hobbies and finish your work as fast as possible

# 3. Eat the frog

[Not literally](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/eat-the-frog). Instead of checking social media and who posted stories on instagram or giving other people likes, get to your day to day activities. This will improve your mood overall and will make you feel better and you'll get to work easier (since you got no distraction from the start)

# 4. Quit #a-t-porn{{porn}} (especially you, boys)

Boost that testosterone start no-fap mofo! It will improve your moods, your ability to talk to people will improve as well and trust me, people (especially girls) detect when guys have fake confidence (porn and no-fap contribute a lot to this), and you don't want a bad first-impression when talking to or meeting someone you genuinely like. My friend's biggest streak was 174 days or something like that, can't remember the exact number, but he told me that he felt so good being porn-free. Do the same and I promise you'll see AT LEAST a slight change in your life

I've got friends who laughed and are laughing at me because I basically live different than them. "Yo yo slow down old man", "you'll eventually hit a burn-out with this lifestyle", "I want to improve my life as well but I don't want to give up these things", "how can you not watch porn bro, are you crazy?" but I don't blame any of them. I've been the same as them and I've been reacting the same to people who told me this kind of stuff. But at the end of the day, it's you that matters the most, so become your best version of yourself and you'll rule the world, I promise that!

You are the one who needs to control these things, not them controlling you!

I hope I helped at least one person with this post! Keep improving your lives! And don't forget to remind yourself **every. single. day.** that you rock!
