#post{{Only time i really missed it was when i was sick in bed. I like to watch movies when i am sick. Usually i dont like to watch them. So i went to my neighbour and got bunch of movies. Problem solved. 

I also miss doing some business online but it also makes me angry and nervous i dont care. Life is to short and time too valuable to spend it angry even if u get money for that so fuck it. Nature is the most beautiful i will try to see it and as much as i can. I still dont know how to help people i hope that will come to me too some day. }}

#post{{I rarely watched TV. I have one 24inch bought only for the world cup 2014. It was turned off from then. Now I watched becaue of Olympics, but I continued to watch those 3 channels i like. I dont have a cable. Its not as bad as internet, but sometimes i watch shows and procrastinate. 

The point is, if you are prone to procrastination you will procrastinate. With ot without internet. Cheers}}
