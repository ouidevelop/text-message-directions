#post{{So first of all, this is not meant as a brag. Nor as an advertisement, even though I have linked some videos further down, they are only providing the same information as this wall of text is. 
  
&amp;nbsp;
 
I just wanted to share this with someone, as I my self have benefitted greatly from this, albeit short, journey of mine.  

&amp;nbsp;
###My Phone Usage (creating a sensible phone)
I realized that my #symp-worse-concentration{{phone was taking away a lot of my attention}}. I was spending 3 hours on it daily doing stuff I didn’t remember. #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}}, #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}}, #a-t-snapchat{{Snapchat}}, #a-t-email{{Emails}} you name it. So I decided to do something about it.

&amp;nbsp;

Following a blog post by [Jake Knapp](https://medium.com/time-dorks/my-year-with-a-distraction-free-iphone-and-how-to-start-your-own-experiment-6ff74a0e7a50) #tech-smart-dumbphone{{I “reinvented” my phone (it needs to sound sexy!) from a smart phone to a sensible phone}}. No more pitfalls to fall into or distraction to get sucked towards. Only smart tools that had real everyday applications.

&amp;nbsp;

That ment no email, no facebook, no instagram, no nothing. #tech-delete{{I just deleted all the apps from my phone}} so I had nothing left other than things like maps, payment, alarm, music, podcast.

&amp;nbsp;

I started with the idea of going 1 week. As an experiment (I do 1-2 week experiments and vlog about it, as an experiment – you know, meta, meta.) And it has now been 4 weeks and I can tell you, I am not changing back. The mere thought of having the apps installed stresses me a bit.   

&amp;nbsp;

But aren’t you missing out? Well … First of all no, I can check stuff in the evenings on my computer. And even if I where, does it matter? #ben-better-sleep{{I sleep better}}. Have an overall better capability of structure, #ben-face-difficulties{{I feel like I can “handle” more problems then I could before.}}

&amp;nbsp;

I would trade that for maybe missing something spontaneous. (which I haven’t.)  
**I urge you to try it. Give it a weekend. You can always install all your apps again!**

&amp;nbsp;

###Deep Work
The next thing I did was read #book-deep-work{{“Deep Work”}} by Cal Newport and although it might be a bit superficial and anecdotal at times, it really struck a chord with me. Very briefly it sets up what it calls the Deep Work Hypothesis:

&amp;nbsp;

 *The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.*  

&amp;nbsp;

And on top of the economic and success-part of the appeal there is a section about how you find your work and as a consequence your life more meaningful by really focusing on what you're doing. As such I thought it made perfect sense to try to be more focused.  

&amp;nbsp;

So I started blocking my usage of the internet on my computer. Limiting it to certain hours and taking breaks away from the internet. (Even though Cal Newport states that you should try to take breaks from focused work, I will get there!) And it’s been beneficial. It has helped me a ton. I am not at the point where I want to be yet, but I have been made very aware of my lacking ability to actually focus. I now realize how addicted I am of interruptions. Something I am keen to combat.   

&amp;nbsp;

###Learning something fun
So the next experiment. The current one. Is to spend my evenings doing something else than surfing around the world wide web. #other-activities-read{{It could be reading a book}}. #other-activities-chores{{Doing the laundry}}. #other-activities-watch-movies-and-tv{{Watching a movie}} (which I am not going to stop because I just want to watch a YouTube-movie at the same time.) Or …

&amp;nbsp;

Or starting to #other-activities-misc{{learn to solve the Rubik’s Cube}}. A feat that I have been trying to learn previously, but never succeeded suddenly took me no more than three evenings of around 1 hour of focus. With some nice soothing music in the background and a cup of tea, I managed to memorize The Beginner’s Method in a total of 3 hours.

&amp;nbsp;

This is not a giant achievement nor do I treat it like one. But a task that I have previously postponed indefinitely was now something that didn’t take that long to do. The same principle applies to this post. I am currently on a train and instead of numbingly playing a game or scrolling social media on my phone I am now changing back and forth between writing and investigating the landscape which we pass by.  

&amp;nbsp;

My next evening goal is to start to read all the books on my book shelves which I have never “had the time” to read.  

&amp;nbsp;

I hope this can inspire you, if you would like I try to create a short insightful video on becoming a better me each week. You can find my videos about a sensible phone, a week without internet, deep work and my newfound love for [Rubik's Cubes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyUqG7mGmZw)}}
