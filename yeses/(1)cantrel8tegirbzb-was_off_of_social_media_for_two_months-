#post{{#tech-delete{{I decided to delete my #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}} app}} and #tech-delete/deactivate-account{{deactivate my #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}}}} two months ago for a few reasons, mostly because #symp-wasted-time{{I was spending way too much time on them}} and also because I had a big upcoming test that was very important I studied hard for. I took that test today and decided to hop back on Instagram and Facebook. #right-mind{{It actually made me disgusted just mindlessly looking at people’s pictures and lives}}. I hope that doesn’t come off as rude or insensitive but #right-mind{{I just felt gross having everyone need to post everything about themselves and needing all the likes and comments possible}}. I realized in that moment how bad social media can be for someone’s mental health. The past two months #ben-productive{{I have been so productive, doing things around the house}}, #other-activities-walk{{going on daily walks}}, #ben-better-connection{{having real intellectual conversations with my husband and family members (on the phone). I also realized I call my grandma more to check in and just to talk when I was on my break}}. I think I’m going to continue to not be on social media for the time being as it isn’t beneficial to me. Maybe even eventually delete it all once and for all.

Edit: I also notice in my time off of Instagram and Facebook I would receive constant emails from Instagram and Facebook saying certain friends had updated their status or uploaded pictures, almost like the apps knew I was off and were trying so hard to get me back on.}}
