#post{{I started my journey in January 15th, 2020, when I #tech-delete{{deleted #a-t-snapchat{{Snapchat}} and #a-t-tiktok{{Tik Tok}}. The next day I deactivated #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}}, #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}} and #a-t-twitter{{Twitter}}.}}

What changed? Covid-19 started, and I don't need to see sooooo much feed. #ben-less-anxiety{{My anxiety reduced}} and #ben-more-time{{I found more time for myself}}. #other-activities-learn{{I started learning Dutch, I also improved my coding skills because I have 2-3 additional hours every single day.}}

What about my friends and followers? I found out that I have only 3 friends. They reached me outside the social media and even invited for a cup of coffee. They even called/texted to wish me a happy birthday. I realized that your number of fake friends is not related to your level of happiness. 

I decided to continue this challenge and go for 365 days. Wish me good luck!
