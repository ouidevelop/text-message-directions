#post{{It's an idea I've had for 3 years that took me 6 months to commit to it.  


No matter what I try, #a-t-twitter{{Twitter}}, #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}}, and email make their way back on my smartphone and so I've decided to go #tech-dumbphone{{[light](https://thelightphone.com/).}}

Here's how I'm circumventing the inconvenience of not having a smartphone.  


**How will I listen to music?**   I purchased the Mighty Vibe from [MightyUnplugged](https://twitter.com/MightyUnplugged). It requires I use my old smartphone to load music from [@Spotify](https://twitter.com/Spotify) or [@amazon](https://twitter.com/amazon).  And I'll pair it with a set of Bluetooth headphones.

**How will I read ebooks &amp; listen to audiobooks?**  I purchased a Kindle Oasis that I'll use for reading ebooks and listening to audible. I'll also use my surface book in tablet mode to read long-form essays and articles online.

**How will I get directions?**  The light phone is working on this feature, but in the meantime, I guess I'll have to print off instructions from mapquest. Luckily, I don't venture too far these days.   


**How will I replace 2FA?**  Purchased multiple Yubikeys from [Yubicos](https://twitter.com/yubicos). When possible use a security key for 2FA and use recovery codes as a backup measure.   


Life will be much less convenient and I'm sure I've not addressed all the shortcomings of not having a smartphone. But I think I'll enjoy living like it's 2005.}}
