#post{{Alright gents, in this post I am going to talk a little bit about what I believe to be my final view on what role the internet should play in someone's life, and in what the best way to use it is.

I first started down this path when I discovered NoFap back in 2011 or 2012. Something about taking away porn #ben-misc{{woke my brain up slightly}}, and #ben-more-intentional{{allowed me to start analyzing my own life to try and find ways to improve it}}. But it wasn't good enough. I still felt that something was wrong, and about a year and a half into my NoFap journey, I finally realized that mindless browsing, if it was releasing dopamine, had to be cut out for the exact same reasons that porn had to be cut out.

Once I realized this, I started devising all sorts of methods to cut down my internet time. I set up #tech-blockers{{filters}}, #tech-use-outside-internet{{disabled my wifi}} and #tech-misc{{only used a wired connection}}, got rid of my smartphone (still #tech-dumbphone{{using a dumbphone}}... one of the best things I ever did btw), etc. But none of these really gave me the results I was looking for. I wanted a completely clear mind.. I wanted to be one hundred percent tuned into reality. I wanted to be outgoing.

So I decided to go really far out onto a limb and try something that I never thought I would do and #tech-use-outside-internet{{cancelled my home internet service. I lived without the internet at home for a complete year}} (at the writing of this post it has been a year).

I find that having the internet in your house.. having a computer with internet nearby, almost #symp-misc{{makes you feel trapped in your house. You don't want to go anywhere... it pulls you in. Turns you into a hermit.}}

But now the opposite! When I want to browse the internet, which I still do because it is very important, I go to a library, a coffee shop, or a cafe. This is great. It makes me get out of the house in order to use the internet, #ben-more-outgoing{{which makes me more outgoing}}, and #ben-more-time{{it keeps me from sitting on the computer for hours at a time}}. Maybe 1 hour a day max and I get everything I need to done (reading the news, paying bills, buying things, etc). If I need to read something deeply, I will just #tech-misc{{download the webpage and look at it later when i get home}}. Youtube videos can be downloaded. You can even download whole websites if you find a blog you like (careful with this one though).

Also, I don't use the internet for entertainment. I stick to physical DVD's and BluRays and Books. I go to the movie theatre. And I will tell you what, #ben-misc{{I feel like a kid again}}.. remember waking up really early to watch that show you loved so much that you would make sure to catch every episode? Remember how amazing that felt.... remember your favorite movie that you watched 700 times? I feel like that again.

Using the internet for entertainment just makes it harder to leave it alone, because your brain begins to depend on it for stimulation. So much so that it can make you rationalize purchasing home internet again. Train your brain to get stimulation from physical media and real people etc. Not from computers. Let computers just be a place you go when you have something you need to do.

So what I will say is this: Don't allow the internet into your home. Treat it like an enemy. #tech-use-outside-internet{{Using the internet at a library or cafe}} is more than enough internet, and plus it trains you to be out around people (social) while online.

Implementing this change has made me basically a superman. I am #ben-live-in-reality{{completely tuned into reality now}}.... so much so that it is almost sickening. #ben-better-senses{{My senses are heightened}} like crazy. I've #ben-notice-more{{been noticing things}} that I never noticed before like the shapes of peoples noses, the color of their eyes.. #ben-better-dressed{{I understand how to dress well for the first time}} in my life because I finally understand colors and shapes. I notice things now like how frantically edited new tv shows and movies are, and have come to appreciate old movies that are very slow paced. People that used to be above me in conversational skills are now so far below me that I have had to change my social circle. People that I used to look up to are now like children to me.

This is how life is supposed to be. Humans are super fucking smart and capable and observant. Reclaim your brain and you will be too.

Break free.}}
