#post{{A few months ago, I made an update on my progress towards completely reducing my consumption of media, and my possessions. I have made progress in some areas, and not so much in others as is to be expected.

My previous post is in *italics*, and the current update is in **bold**.

*I started by slowly #tech-deactivate/delete-account{{removing my online accounts}}. All of the ones I did  not use/plan to use got deleted. I consolidated all of my accounts that I  absolutely can't live without.*

**This is a work in progress by nature. As time goes on, accounts get added. But I have removed major players (Payment processors, shopping accounts) and I consider that a net positive.**

*I joined better/more secure services that do not use me as a product. I  focused on intentionally cutting out the Alphabet companies and going  for alternatives.*

**I have done well in this category as well. I have almost no accounts with google, ms, fb, etc.**

*I left all social media platforms -- except for the couple of apps I absolutely need for keeping in touch with important people.*

**I am proud that I am no longer a member of any 'forward facing' social media platforms. Though I do have a discord and mastodon. I consider these to be a good compromise.**

*#tech-delete{{I've slowly phased out gaming to the point where I can live without it  easily. I started with deleting Val/League/CS which were the most  problematic. Now I allow myself to enjoy some single player games, but  multiplayer games are just too addicting and can't be apart of that.}}*

**This has been my biggest challenge. I do still #a-t-games{{play games}}, but way less than I used to.**

I *#tech-remove-devices{{completely wiped my gaming PC/Sold/Gave Away the parts. I am sticking strictly to my laptop where it is harder to game/waste time and much easier to be productive.}}*

**Great progress here as well. Put countless technology devices in the trash (after wiped for privacy). The journey to discovering the best way to get rid of technology was interesting, as it isn't as simple as other household items.**

*#tech-unsubscribe{{Slowly phase out my spending on subscriptions/services I do not use or that waste my time.}}*

**I am down to 3 essential subscription services!**

*Completely cut out #a-t-porn{{pornography}} consumption and replace it with something more useful (I have been making progress towards this as well*

**This is an up and down battle that isn't covered by the scope of this post. But I have made meaningful progress in this area, and my mental health is a lot better.**

*Ultimately have the least amount of devices that cover the most amount of purpose. My ideal goal is to have one computer and a minimalist phone that  covers everything I need.*

**This is the best area. I have 1 phone, 1 tablet, 1 laptop. It is so much simpler and I am keeping it this way.**

I doubt anyone remembers my initial post. But for those who are on a similar journey I hope this helps to motivate and inform! I will try to answer questions as much as I can. Certain information has been changed for privacy concerns.}}
