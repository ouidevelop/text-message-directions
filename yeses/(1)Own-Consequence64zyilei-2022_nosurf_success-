#post{{Throwaway because I don't have a real reddit account (obviously lol).

Thought I'd make a post about my successful experience with nosurf in 2022. There are a lot of negative and hopeless-sounding posts here so I want to do my small part to show that success is possible. I'm defining success for me as no longer having any real urge to browse #a-t-reddit{{reddit}} or #a-t-twitter{{twitter}} (my two addictive sites) and being disinterested in the content if I do look at them (how did I ever find this dreck interesting?). I don't have statistics but at the start of the year I would spend most of the day on my laptop, now on a typical day I don't use my laptop at all and only use my phone for texting and looking up words in the language I'm learning.

I don't have an ingenious method or simple hack to get rid of your internet addiction, my approach was to #tech-slow-progress{{keep introducing more and more friction into my device usage and continuing to plug away at it}}. This involved rather ridiculous methods. For instance #tech-obscure-password{{I set my laptop password to a random 64 character string that I wrote down on a piece of paper.}} It can take me several minutes to get logged in now. Anyway, here are some observations about internet addiction I have. Doubtlessly unoriginal but it's what I have:

* Your internet addiction is almost certainly a coping mechanism for something else. This means unfortunately you're probably not going to kick your reddit habbit then be happy and healthy for the rest of your life. You need to fix your actual issues. The good news is you'll have lots of time to do this.

* I think it can be helpful to really, really think about how these sites fundamentally operate. They compete to get your attention and show you ads, or in other words they convert your life into revenue. It's deranged! Ironic detachment is the cultural norm right now it seems like but if you can get out of that and #tech-misc{{really feel just how disgusting social media is I think it can help a lot, especially when it gets hard}}. #tech-misc{{Paradoxically realizing I am a victim was empowering, it made my struggle meaningful.}}

* Pretty much everything is better "analog", the annoying parts that tech automates away are what enriches the experience. I'm not 100% on this though, for instance I think spotify has let me listen to a lot of interesting music I would never have encountered otherwise. But I'd recommend maintaining an attitude of extreme skepticism towards anything digital until it demonstrates otherwise.

* Real life meaningful relationships are indescribably beautiful and make being online seem incredibly pathetic in comparison. Please go make some friends if you don't have any, or become closer with them if you do have them (maybe that acquittance you have could be your bff if you got to know them better). I don't have the secret^TM to making friends either, but please try.

Don't have much else to say, like I said I don't have some secret technique or insight. I'm just a guy. I hope anyone reading this has a good 2023 and I look forward to not seeing you around!}}
