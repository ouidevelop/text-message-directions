#post{{So i see alot of posts on here about dumb phones, what to get, how it improves things, what they're missing etc and I often comment and then get questions (not a dig, I don't mind people asking), I know when I was on the hunt for something other than a smart phone I'd have loved just some more info on people's experiences but the fact of the matter is people don't have an experience with them, that's the point! Their phone becomes something less important.

I wrote this out in reply to someone and figured I may as well post it on here for anyone who's interested to read/discuss. (I have edited it a touch from the actual reply, I ended up getting quite excited and going off on mini rants ðŸ˜‚)

So around 2 years or so ago #symp-feel-bad{{I was pretty unhappy with my smart phone usage (and in general, funny that ðŸ¤”)}} so started looking into phone/social media addiction, I'd had dumb phone when I was a kid etc and almost longed for that simplicity back so started looking into simpler phones. I considered the light phone and another Swedish phone I can't remember for a looooonng time but they were just daft money and they seemed to have big software issues, I also felt that although they really fit everything I was after, I just didn't know if I was strong enough to commit to it, and didn't want to spend that sort of cash to end up leaving it in a drawer. Then #tech-dumbphone{{Nokia brought out their classics range.}}

At the time I had quit #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}} which was a game changer, #ben-freedom{{I felt so free}}, it was amazing (if you haven't, please consider this, it did wonders for my mental health and I have not once regretted it). I still had messenger and #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}}, I bought my 3310 (in Argos in the UK for about Â£50) and was suddenly left with this brick that couldn't entertain me, I #withdrawal-misc{{felt a little lost}}, but I persevered. I had been slowly getting people to text me more than WhatsApp by telling them I didn't have internet and leaving WhatsApp messages unread so people got used to it and slowly but surely they did. Messenger and Instagram didn't last long when they weren't constantly in my pocket so they went pretty quickly, I still have a WhatsApp account and a reddit account on a tablet that I check every now and again but only for sending photos etc and I feel that whatsapp may go soon tbh..people text or call me, it's easy, I have my phone on loud all the time as the only time it goes off is if someone actually wants me (it's an odd feeling, no longer having a phantom vibrate every few minutes). If its just something they need to ask or say its a text, if its a natter they want, which woukd have normally be done by a series of messages, they call me. People have told me that they enjoy our conversations and the fact they have to call as it forces them to stop and have a chat, kinda like a cigarette break from life.

With regards to the phone, the #ben-battery-life{{battery lasts me about 3 or 4 days with fairly heavy usage}}, takes around an hour to charge I guess and it turns out I used to get quite stressed over whether I had enough charge or somewhere to charge my phone, I just didn't realize how much these small things affected me. The #bad{{camera is a potato}} but it has a torch! I plan my routes before I go out, I also take a book as I realized the second I got rid of my smart phone I had nothing to do in those waiting around moments and #other-activities-read{{books filled that void, you can't be productive all the time}}, don't kick yourself for it, just don't use that down time to turn your brain to smoothie. You can live without maps, emails get checked once a day (it's email, that's kinda the point, if it's urgent, don't email it!), you can see things through your eyes instead of a screen, you can order food the old fashioned way, I'm not sure what else I'm meant to be missing ðŸ˜‚ I don't think I'd change it for anything else, #ben-freedom{{it's an amazing sense of freedom that can't really be explained!}}}}
