#post{{Have some free time and I remember that this subreddit exists and I want to share my experience (and hopefully anyone struggling can find my post useful).

I was a huge #symp-wasted-time{{time waster}} on #a-t-facebook{{facebook}} for years, and the negativity I got from that website has #symp-feel-bad{{always been a huge issue to my mental health}}. #symp-comparing{{Seeing *friends* sharing superficial pictures of their *success* has always made me feel bad and compare myself to others}}. Then the politics and virtue signaling posts. My rare moments that I actually enjoyed on that hellhole were random animal pictures. I kept telling myself "maybe I will miss something important if I don't use facebook, maybe I need my daily dose of funny cat videos to keep myself happy". So I made extensive use of FBPurity (an extension that blocks ads and more on facebook) to block out all the contents that I didn't like. But it was to no avail, some posts always managed to slip past my guard. Then COVID hit and everyone went on social networks. And thus more contents that made me feel like shit.

Besides facebook itself, #a-t-chat{{messenger}} was also a huge time sink for me. I noticed that I kept checking messenger every few minutes for new messages because sometimes the notifications didn't come through, and you know how harmful #symp-fomo{{FOMO}} can be. My facebook and messenger usage added up to 2 hours or more everyday. That was a lot of time wasted for nothing good, just my declining mental health.

Because facebook was my only means of contact with some of my past coworkers or some of my family members, deleting my account was out of the question. I tried out two things: removing the messenger extension on my browser sidebar (I use opera) and #tech-blockers{{adding an adblock filter to hide my entire news feed}}. So it was not a permanent deletion, but adding a couple extra steps if I ever wanted to use facebook. Surprisingly, these simple solutions worked extremely well for me. Because I was scrolling facebook mindlessly every time I opened up a new browser tab for facebook, being the lazy person I am, nowadays I simply close the tab if I ever open facebook by force of habit (Ctrl+T, F, Enter. Now that I think about it, this is an extremely easy flow to hit on the keyboard). I haven't opened my facebook page in months, and I only check messenger once before work and once after work everyday now. That's 2 more hours everyday I could spend on better things.

Comes the next big thing I sunk my time in: #a-t-reddit{{reddit}}. After 2 weeks of my facebook free life, I decided it's time I #tech-delete{{nuke my reddit accounts}}. I was not a huge reddit user (at least not as much as I used facebook), but it still took a couple hours of my time every week. Because I was a heavy facebook user but I had no withdrawal after 2 weeks, I reckoned reddit couldn't be worse and I just rolled with it then [nuked everything](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nuke-reddit-history/aclagjkmidmkcdhkhlicmgkgmpgccaod?hl=en) without a second thought. Similar to how I dealt with facebook, I added an adblock filter that blocked the reddit feed `www.reddit.com##.ListingLayout-outerContainer`. Reddit posts are spared because I still need to read posts when I look for stuff on google and reddit comes up. If I ever need to post anything (like this post for example), I create a new account using 10minutemail, use a random password generator, generate a long ass complex password that I will never remember, make my post, log out, and that's it. No more arguing with random people on the internet, no more checking out time consuming posts that I shouldn't waste my time on.

I was never an user of other social networks (instagram, twitter, etc.) I still use #a-t-youtube{{youtube}} heavily, but just for ambient asmr sound stuff and I never surf youtube anyway, so youtube doesn't eat into my actual time. These are the measures I took for social networks on PC. Fortunately, I never had to do anything with my phone because of how these stupid websites try to push their shitty apps. If I'm too lazy to disable a filter to use your sites, you can bet your ass I'll never install your fucking shitty apps to use your equally shitty sites.

What did I do with my #ben-more-time{{extra time}}? #other-activities-exercise{{Workout}}, #other-activities-cook{{learning how to cook}}, #a-t-games{{gaming}} (you can't take gaming away from me). I have been 16 months clean, #ben-better-looks{{gained quite a bit of muscle, looked visibly different that I managed to shock my family when I met them after a year}}, #ben-better-sleep{{changed from going to bed at 6am to hitting the sack at 1am now}}, cleared over a dozen games that I never had time to play before.

Good thing I was never into twitter. I probably would have committed not alive way before I managed to graduate from social networks had I used that shit of a site.}}
