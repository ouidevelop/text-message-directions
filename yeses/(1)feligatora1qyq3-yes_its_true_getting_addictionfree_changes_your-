#post{{**Who i am &amp; where i come from**

Short form: 22 y/o from Germany (so English is my second language, be aware!), college student. Had my own computer since the age of 12 and spend way to much time of my youth in front of it. In addition to this, smartphone addiction kicked in with getting my first at the age of 16. 

My actual change in behavior started in the last year: at first, it was just a feeling of #symp-feel-bad{{"something is wrong, i feel bad, i feel confused"}} which i step by step referred to my intense use of screens. Reading books on this topic, finding this sub and doing a quite painful reflection of my past and present state really helped me identify the problem. As is already had #symp-suicidality{{thoughts of suicide}}, things needed to change, fast!

&amp;#x200B;

**What did i do?** 

Over a time span of around 4 weeks, i killed all my social media step by step. #tech-not-work{{First i deleted the app icon's from my phone's start screen}}. As this didn't really work out,  #tech-delete{{i deleted the apps}} and finally #tech-deactivate/delete-account{{deleted my accounts}}. This worked quite well for me, but for others a hard cut may be the better way. Do what fit's your case the best!

Furthermore, i put my phone in #tech-misc{{"do not disturb"}}-mode, so my phone was not actively craving for attention. It was only my addiction that kept grabbing for my phone all the time - which, as a side effect, showed how bad the problem was.

I also started to #tech-ask-why-when-picking-up-phone{{reflect and think about my usage. Is this really the way i want to spend my days and life? Aimlessly browsing social media and the web? I really got sick of this thought of wasting my life by this addiction.}}

**What happened after i killed social media and stopped surfing?**  

\- Obviously, i got #ben-more-time{{way more free time}}. Which i now use for way better things: #other-activities{{improve my flat}}, #other-activities{{care for my plants}}, #other-activities{{do more sports}}, #other-activities{{read more}}, #other-activities{{reflect about my life}} ...

\- #ben-remember-dreams-more{{I remember my dream(s) of every single night}}, instead of just once in a while. This is probably the must unexpected effect, but it show's how deep the addictions impact on our brain seems to be.

\- #right-mind{{Using my smartphone feels "wrong" now}}, and the same goes for my desktop pc. Just weeks ago i would sit in front of it for several hours a day - now i don't event want to put it on. It's crazy.

\- #ben-better-connection{{I talk to people in a different way - i hold more eye contact, shake hands stronger, listen more carefully, talk to strangers just because it's fun to get to know new people.}}

\- The addiction is gone. Which is a wonderful #ben-in-control{{feeling of self control.}}

\- #ben-better-attention{{Concentration has gone up}}. I am now able to read or work for a way longer time, before my mind starts to wander of.

\- I feel #ben-less-anxiety{{less stressed and more calm}}. I think this  goes together with the point of increased concentration.

**Next step**

As my current smartphone is still the primal source of distraction (incoming messages, mails or other notifications),  I want to buy a second smartphone now. It will have a separate number which only the most important part of my friends &amp; family will become. By this they are able to reach me in cases of emergency or for spontaneous and urgent things. My first smartphone will stay at home (when not at home) or in a corner of my room and can be used for relaxing and entertainment at *specific* times a day.
