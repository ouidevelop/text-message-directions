#post{{About 3 months ago #tech-nosurf{{i stumbled across Nosurf}}. It had been something i had made just another "mental note" on prior to stumbling upon it. I wanted to give up the internet and most electronics/mindlesd technology. For a decade i had told myself someday i would get rid of it, and just like so many others with addictions, someday became a month, which turned into year after year after year.

So basically what i did is I started small first, and took baby steps. I cut back on mindless browsing first. Maybe an hour or 2 less a day. After a week #other-activities-misc{{i supplemented my free time with Gundam models}} ( r/Gunpla for those interested), since i had grown up with the series and had always been interested in it. #tech-do-other-things{{By the way they call that stuff plastic crack, which is fitting because it quickly ate into my online time}}, which for me was good. Within a month i had gone from 6 to 12 hours a day online to 3 to 6.

I was spending less time mindlessly browsing and more time researching. I still wasnt satisfied. I knew that i was still on the internet doing stuff i honestly mostly didnt need to he doing. I decreased my usage even more. #tech-misc{{I started giving myself a strict reward system to try to force the part of me still hanging on to the internet, to be productive offline, so i could later have a little bit of time to be online meaningly.}}

Suffice to say this didnt work like I wanted it too. I reall struggled staying true to the system and cheated alot. But at the 1.5 month mark, no matter how i looked at it, I still was spending significantly less time online browsing mindlessly.    

#ben-productive{{I may not have had any passion forcing myself to be productive but the point is i was still doing it}}. Around this time of 1.5 months, i started to, for the first time in almost a decade, have a real desire to pursue other things i either never had before, or things i had quit doing. And i wasnt bothered nearly as much about not spending time online every fucking minute of my waking life. It was exhilerating.

I was actually starting to dislike being online all the time. When i thought of being online id be like "no thats a waste of time, i could use that time to do such and such" and previously thoughts like that never crossed my mind.  Rarely anyways...

#ben-self-improvement{{So around this time another wondrous thing happened. I started having the desire to improve other things. My relationships with people and family.}} I started looking inwardly at my life and researching self help, stuff i normally passed off as quack wisdom.

#ben-take-responsibility{{Before i knew it i was for the first time in my life admitting certain negative things in my life were indeed in fact my own fault.}} Things i had blamed on others for over a decade, things i always made excuses for. #ben-honest-with-self{{I started also learning to admit defeat on certain life goals i had long since failed on, but had struggled all my life to admit that, and had beaten myself up over for the longest time.}}

And not just that, I started making the real effort to improve upon all sorts of mental/social/personality issues. I started taking responsibility and following through on promises to others, and stopped making so many of these damn "mental notes" that never got me anywhere. I started taking real initiative and action on these "mental notes". Next thing i know 3 months later...  

And i barely get online anymore. Ive used #a-t-reddit{{reddit}} maybe 3 times this past month. Mindlessly browsed probably less then an hour total. My time is filled with other activities. #other-activities-misc{{Model kits}}. #other-activities-read{{Reading books}}. #other-activities-being{{Spending time in nature}}. #other-activities-music-listening{{Just sitting down and listening to music without doing anything else. Actually listening to the music and not letting it become background noise.}}

#ben-feel-better{{I feel so good.}} #ben-freedom{{So free}}. I feel better then ive felt in over a decade. #ben-better-connection{{I spend more time with my wife}}. I spend more time being productive. If i think of something i want to do, then i go out an do it. I stopped reading the news almost totally. I dont change my opinion for others anymore just to "fit in". I mostly spend my time and money much more wisely now. Im taking interests and pursuing hobbies and new passions.

#tech-misc{{One thing that helped me the most is every week if sit down and write out:

My Improvements - big or small i recognized all of them to myself.  

Things Still needing Improvement - i let it all out. No excuses here. Even if i didnt like to hear it i spilled my heart and soul and guts out and wrote it all down. Even things i still was having struggles letting go of or admitting, i made sure to write it down.  

Things i want to start/start again: any new ideas or hobbies. Any mental or social things i wanted to improve on. Etc. Regardless of how silly or farfetched it sounded. 

And then for the whole day i wrote it, id periodically read it every hour or 2. And then at the end of the day id make an effort to let go of the negative past, and improve the things that needed inproving, and pick 1 to 3 things new to start on the next week. I still do this. Today I started a new list. And tonight I will burn it.}}

I am so much happier with my life now.
