#post{{I'm back to smartphone before 2020. And I'm noticing that I'm using my phone to help myself instead of killing time. I bought a used phone . I have no desire to watch mindless YouTube video or anything like that. The dumb phone is still my primary phone though. 

I got this phone for 

1. Navigation(Google map)

2. Some useful online activities like posting ads to sell stuff ,looking up some information like a tutorial video or a blog post. Online shopping etc .`

3. I need some application like ankidroid flashcards app, notes, dictionary, Google drive, voice recorder and WhatsApp and some other useful apps.

4. And little bit of entertainment like movies and music like once in a while. 

For the above activities I had to use my sister's phone which was making me question my decision to downgrade to a dumb phone.

For reading I have brought a Kindle and I'm spending most of my free time reading on that device.

I believe this 39 days of dumb phone use helped me reflect on my mindless behaviour of internet/phone usage .

Internet/phone addiction is a real thing. And I believe social media is hugely responsible for it . I have no social media apps on my phone and will never have.}}
