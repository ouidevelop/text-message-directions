#post{{For the past 30 days I have been doing a “digital declutter”. I have purged any unnecessary hardware and software from my daily life. I started this process after reading [#book-digital-minimalism{{Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World}}]( https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy-ebook/dp/B07DBRBP7G/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1SRB8B86P9RUF&amp;keywords=digital+minimalism&amp;qid=1560285274&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=digital+min%2Caps%2C193&amp;sr=8-1). I highly recommend this book. It provides realistic techniques for reducing digital cruft in today’s world.

The past 30 days have had some ups and downs as far as daily life goes. Starting out with the positives; #other-activities-read{{I have read more books in the past 30 days that I have in the past 3 years combined}}. #ben-better-reading-writing{{I am able to tear through a book in only a few days and I feel like I am retaining the information more}}. #ben-less-anxiety{{I suffer from Anxiety and Panic Disorder and I feel like reducing the number of pings and distractions have really helped reduce daily anxiety.}} #other-activities-exercise{{I have found more time to exercise}} and #ben-better-attention{{I am able to involve my body and mind more into the exercise}}. I started Yoga back in January and only noticed minor improvements, I believe this is because I always practiced with some kind of distraction on the TV or with a podcast or music playing. #ben-better-attention{{Now that I am providing yoga my full attention I am able to concentrate more and hold harder poses for longer.}} #ben-better-work{{The biggest benefit I have found is that I am able to concentrate at work much more}} than before I began this declutter. I used to constantly have a tab open for web browsing between tasks. I never gave my mind any time to relax; I was constantly giving myself some shiny new distraction to focus on. I have since completely stopped web browsing at work. I also no longer listen to podcasts or audiobooks while working. I would zone out while listening to them and not retain any of the information. I now listen to them on my commute or in my off time and I am enjoying them a lot more.

There have been some cons during this declutter. I have a self-imposed rule that I cannot look up anything (non-work related) until I get home and have scheduled computer time. I have kept a notebook with a page of topics I want to search, but I have found that by the end of the day I only end up looking up one or two of these topics. For the #withdrawal-time{{first two weeks}} #withdrawal-fomo{{I had intense FOMO}}. I typically am the person that is up on the latest breaking news and tech, it felt very strange not keeping a constant dip feed of news and blogs open during the day. The FOMO really stopped once I had found out I missed an Apple event that had new hardware and software announcements and a pokemon nintento direct; usually I would have stopped anything I was doing to watch these and then devour any articles relating to them. But this time I didn’t even find out until days later and only because it came up in a conversation with friends. I realized that I didn’t really miss out, I just got delayed news and it made a lot of the information much less exciting (in a very good way). #withdrawal-time{{The negative that is still occurring[[one month]]}} #withdrawal-bored{{is boredom}}. I find myself feeling bored sometimes, I would normally try to remedy this by pulling out my phone and browsing #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}} or #a-t-reddit{{reddit}}, but now I must learn how to just be bored sometimes. I am still finding the feeling of boredom uncomfortable, but it has already got a lot easier as the month progressed.

I did have to make some compromises in order to complete this declutter. I know some of you may say these compromises nullify the whole experience, but I don’t think they do. The biggest compromise is that I must use a computer for work. I work in IT and am constantly checking systems and monitoring email and slack. Some ways I have tried to limit the computer usage as much as possible was to #tech-misc{{switch to a paper notebook}}. I used to take all my notes on a computer, but I have found that writing them out helps me to retain the information. I have also set up email rules that allow me to monitor email less, I now have it set to ping me when an email from any VIP comes through and I just have a reminder set to check email every 30 minutes for any other emails. I am also doing some light #a-t-games{{video game playing}}. I just reintroduced this in the past few days and I think it has been fine. In the past I would buy games, play 10 minutes, then never pick them up again. I would get distracted by general browsing. I am now allowing myself to play a few hours on the weekends and I have been enjoying my time with them much more. (Check out Outer Wilds. It has been a great space exploration adventure a game). I do also still use electronic devices every day. I use my cell phone for texting, phone calls, and pokemon go. I use an ipad for reading comic books. And I use a kindle to read books. I picked up a few physical books from the library at the start of these 30 days, but I still preferred to read on a digital device, mostly due to the weight and the ability to read in the dark easily. I have my phone and ipad on do not disturb mode permanently, so I do not get pings on them.

There are a few things I have noticed about myself during this process. I miss web browsing a lot less than I thought I would. #withdrawal-time{{The first two weeks}} #withdrawal-misc{{were difficult}}, but it got exponentially easier as time went on. I stuck to almost all of my self-imposed limitations. I never reinstalled any additional apps on my phone, I never checked social media, and I never broke my rule about searching topics outside of scheduled times. I still don’t have a lot of motivation to do housework and run errands. Housework still seems more boring than just sitting there. I am going to have to find a better way of getting my news. For the past 30 days I relied on conversations with friends and coworkers to find out what was going on in the news. I may try subscribing to a paper newspaper or some type of service that curates articles and emails them to you (I am open to suggestions for this). The last thing is that I am very worried about reintroducing items as time goes on. #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}} and Reddit were my biggest vices because I always felt like I was ‘learning’ when using these platforms. I still think there is some value to be had in these services, but I now know that I cannot mindlessly browse these sites anymore. If I need to find out some information I need to be very precise and focused on what I am looking for.

I apologize if this is rambling, I do not regularly write anything. I will check back and answer any questions or comments throughout the day, but after that I am out! Good luck on your nosurf journey!}}
