#post{{I have set up my pc and my mobile phone in a way that I can access entertainment for only 3 hours on a Sunday from 19:00 to 22:00.

#tech-blocker-cold-turkey{{Every other day I have Coldturkey Blocker}} along with #tech-blockers{{Qustodio blocking any sites containing entertainment.}}

No #a-t-youtube{{youtube}}, #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}}, #a-t-tv-and-movies{{Netflix}} or anything #a-t-games{{gaming}} or entertainment related.

&amp;#x200B;

On my phone, I use #tech-blockers{{AppBlocker}} along with #tech-blockers{{AppLocker}}.

&amp;#x200B;

#tech-obscure-password{{In both cases, I set a long password and then write it on paper and put it somewhere that is hard to reach.}}

Currently, I keep both of the passwords on paper at my parents' house. So when I get the cravings, the effort is not worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

#tech-scheduled-off-time{{I also set Frozen Turkey mode in ColdTurkey Blocker which will close the access to the pc from 22:00 to 6:00.}}

And the same on my phone.

#ben-better-sleep{{This has fixed the problem of going to sleep late.}}

This has fixed many problems and forced me to deal with my problems straight on.

&amp;#x200B;

I kept telling myself that I need Youtube or Reddit for education, but this is not the case, just a rationalization.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind, I'm highly addicted to the internet, so this means I need more of an extreme method, you might get by with less.}}

#post{{ Hi, I have improved my internet addiction prevention setup, I hope you get some ideas from this post.

Just a note, I have declined my internet use by 95% in the last 6 months. So what I'm doing seems to work for me, but it might not work for you, you must find your way of dealing with this problem. This might be a bit extreme for you, but it works for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially the applications I use to combat my addiction are:

**PC:**

1. **#tech-blocker-cold-turkey{{Cold Turkey Blocker}}**
2. **#tech-blockers{{Qustodio}}**
3. **#tech-youtube-extension{{DF Tube}}**
4. **#tech-track-time{{RescueTime}}**

&amp;#x200B;

**Cold Turkey Blocker** is set so I have Frozen Turkey Mode (No access to pc whatsoever mode) 23:00 - 07:00.

This prevents me from sacrificing my sleep for my addiction. I have also set my pc to power off at 23:00 to save power.

Essentially I understood that full-on quitting internet cold turkey wasn't for me. I hear people deleting their Facebook accounts and whatnot, but I find this to be extreme. The reasoning for this is FOMO (Fear of missing out).

#tech-time-limits{{I have created an allowance of 15 minutes a day for my distracting websites. (Youtube, Reddit, Instagram, etc...)}}

I have set up a bookmark folder on chrome that opens all the websites I most frequently visit. Reddit websites have been bookmarked as the subforum's top posts of the last 24 hours. Which means I get to catch up every morning.

I wake up In the morning, make some coffee, open my bookmarked websites, catch up on the top posts, youtube subscriptions for the 15 minutes I have allowed which is just enough time and that's it.

This eliminates the fear of missing out, I catch the top news and top things that are important to me.

I have also set my allowance for my chrome browser for 1.5 hours, so when I can't use the distracting websites, I won't waste my time on anything I don't need. Cold Turkey Blocker only counts the time when the actual distracting item is open. I have however set 3 hours free on Sunday from 20:00 - 23:00 which allows me to pig out as they say. 

Get my dose of entertainment, watch a movie, but I don't play any video games, I deem them a waste of time personally.

I have set a password created with a random password generator that is long and impossible to remember, written it on paper and left it at my parents' house. So I can only change my allowances when it is needed, not when my addiction gets the best of me.

**Qustodio** is set so it blocks websites by categories, basically anything that I deem as a waste of time.

I have blocked gaming, pornography, entertainment, etc.... This is kind of double blocking combined with cold turkey blocker.

**DF Tube** is set so that the youtube welcoming screen is empty and the are no suggestions aside from the videos.

I have comments and subscriptions allowed because this is content that I have chosen to see, not purposefully chosen for me by the algorithms.

**RescueTime** is simply there for me to see my progress and how much time I waste with what website or software. In the last 6 months, I have seen a 95% decline in my internet and computer use. So what I'm doing seems to work.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mobile Phone: (Android)**

#tech-blockers{{1. **AppBlocker**}}
#tech-blockers{{2. **AppLocker**}}

&amp;#x200B;

**AppBlocker** is set similarly to my pc. 23:00 - 07:00 most apps are blocked. The only exception is chrome for 5 minutes, in case I need it as an emergency.

In the day time, I have allowed 3 minutes of facebook, 3 minutes of Instagram, 10 minutes of chrome, 15 minutes for an ebook reader app. I have deactivated and uninstalled Reddit and youtube.

**AppLocker** allowed me to lock apps with a password, I added a lock to uninstalling anything, so I can't uninstall my AppBlocker app easily. I set a long password and once again, left it at a hard to reach a place at my parents' house.

So this is essentially how I manage my addiction.

&amp;#x200B;

**Extra Tip:** (#tech-unsubscribe{{Declutter and unsubscribe from youtube channels and email subscriptions, Instagram, etc}}...)

I took a cold hard look at my subscriptions.

Most of the things I subscribed to were added when I was 12 years old. They served no purpose.

My Gmail had 3000 emails. Most of these were news feed and advertising subscriptions.

I had subscribed to 950 Youtube channels. 

And I had followed way too many people on Instagram.

I took some time and only allowed the essential subscriptions and my internet use has taken a dip.

I unsubscribed from **EVERY** youtube channel and trust me they don't make it easy, you have to manually unsubscribe from every channel, but I looked for a script that unsubscribed from them all really fast and then only subscribed to the ones I needed. 

I took a look at my Gmail subscriptions and I manually unsubscribed from most of them, and then filtered them by the sender address and deleted all the emails. 

So this is it, I hope you find something useful from this.}}
