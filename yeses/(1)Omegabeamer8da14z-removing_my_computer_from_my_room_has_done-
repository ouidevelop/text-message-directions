#post{{Hi guys, 31 year old guy here who had, or maybe still has, severe internet addiction. My family brought a computer when I was 13 and by 14 years old I was just hooked on it. My life was basically #a-t-games{{video games}} and internet.

Things got way worse when I got high speed internet and a better computer in my late teens. #a-t-porn{{Porn}}, #a-t-chat{{chat}}, #a-t-youtube{{useless videos}}, endless browsing, you name it that was my life. Not to say I never did anything else, but that was mainly what did.

I have try my best to take breaks from the internet, but I never could manage more than two days. #tech-put-devices-away{{I eventually started putting my computer elsewhere}} and gradually build it on it.

I went from a few days to a few weeks to a month in half. Mind you this is years of doing this.

Last year I had my computer in my basement from the end of May to mid October (started to be cold in the basement). This was by far the least amount of time I spent online in the past 16 years at the time.

Once it got cold in the basement, I brought it back in my room and all the bad habits came back after a week in a half. 

Early March I decided enough is enough and that I simply cannot have my computer in my room ever again, regardless of how cold the basement is. 

Fast forward to now and my internet usage has drastically gone down. #ben-feel-better{{I'm in a better mood}} and focus on repairing my body from a bus accident a few years ago and years of sitting with bad posture.

A big help is having it in a place where there is often people. Having someone distracting me helped me snapped out of it and be more aware that I'm wasting my time. 

It's hard to understand, because my life hasn't became more interesting and I still have a lot of free time (I don't work or go to school) yet I don't have this craving to just be online for 12-16 hours a day or being in front of a screen even when there is no one around. I do spend a lot of time doing "nothing", but I'm fine with that.

I don't want to act as if I never go online or don't waste time online, it's just  that 1-6 hours every now and then is way better than 12-16 hours everyday. I feel like I'm getting my life back on track.

Bonus: #tech-put-devices-away{{I have a no cell phone in my room rule as well}}, but this has been harder to apply. Though I have been pretty good at leaving my phone elsewhere before I go to sleep.}}
