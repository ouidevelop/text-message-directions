#post{{hello to everyone! i hope you are all doing well. #tech-delete{{i deleted my social media apps starting with tiktok at the beginning of august. to ensure a good transition, i deleted one app a week}} and only kept youtube (for music videos) and reddit (because i'm applying to college!) it has officially been about three months and i just want to let anyone who is thinking about deleting their social media know that not only is it possible, but it is a decision you wont regret. im not going to come with some my life changed and now im a perfect person crap because it's just not true, but what i can tell you is i just got the #ben-better-school{{best grades of my entire life at school}}, i feel the #ben-being-present{{most present with my family and friends than ever}}, and #ben-misc{{i don't feel consumed by what people are saying or doing anymore}}! despite being disconnected from social networks, #ben-better-connection{{i have never felt more connected to real life}}. #symp-wasted-time{{i used to say i didn't have time for anything but i was really just mindlessly scrolling for so long that i didn't have any time left.}} let me tell you once you put your phone down you will realize #ben-more-time{{there is plenty of time}}, you just need to learn how to manage it. just wanted to come on here and post this, i know i would have loved to see something similar before deleting my accounts. good luck everyone!!}}
