#post{{Last month I made a few major changes:

* #tech-blocker-cold-turkey{{Blocked all distracting websites (Cold Turkey)}}
* #tech-remove-devices{{Disconnected cable (still own a Chromecast)}}
* #other-activities-misc{{Set up a personal wiki}}
* Created a new habit system

What I noticed isn't groundbreaking but thought I'd share it.

**Blocking websites isn't going to solve the underlying issue**

My #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}} use went from 29 hours to 108 minutes which I'm really happy with. At the same time, I suddenly spent 29 hours on my new wiki. Sure, I went through courses on HTML, CSS, JS and PHP but are courses truly productive or just a new way to procrastinate?

I also found other ways to procrastinate. I began playing a bit more and had meaningless discussions on #a-t-discord{{Discord}}. Eventually I blocked both #a-t-games{{Steam}} and Discord but there were always something new such as #a-t-games{{GOG}}, #a-t-games{{Origin}}, #a-t-games{{Uplay}} or my phone. The last one I found especially tricky to deal with.

**Blocking online stores was amazing**

I can't put my finger on this but somehow I end up on #a-t-shopping{{online stores}}. It might be someone mentioning a sale on a forum or a product in a YouTube video. In July, I spent a total of 13 hours on online stores. Amazon Prime Day being the main culprit with 3 hours. The thing is that I don't need anything.

So I blocked all of them except Amazon.com. The reasoning being that I can use the site for Kindle and research but since it's across the Atlantic, I would never buy anything. I spent a total of 17 minutes on it in August. If I desperately need to buy something, I can just use my phone or get my laptop out of the closet.

**A quote from Sam Harris made me more aware**

&gt;The one thing that people tend to realize is that they wasted a lot of time - when life was normal. It's just not what they did with their time, it's what they cared about. They regret what they cared about. And this is a paradox of course, because we all know this epiphany is coming. Don't you know this is coming? Don't you know there's going to come a day when you'll be sick or someone close to you will die and you'll look back at the kind of things that captured your attention and.. what was I doing? You know this, yet, if you're like most people, you'll spend most of your time in life tacitly presuming that you'll live forever. Watching a bad movie for the fourth time.. These things only makes sense in light of eternity. Because even if you live to be a hundred, there's just not that many days in life.

The quote is taken from [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W16YFgJ_RU).

As he says, everyone knows this. Yet, we continue to waste our time doing things we don't really enjoy. It made me abandon season 2 of The Terror and I'm trying to become more aware and stop doing things that don't give me anything back. Especially following ridiculous arguments.

**Having a wiki completely changed how I learn**

Earlier this summer I went through a CSS course on Udemy and took some notes as I usually do. Then last month, when I began moving the notes to my new wiki, it dawned on me that I had lost the context and what the notes really meant. I went through it again and found some great screenshots for my wiki on the subject. Similarly, I often found myself going from one beginners course to another because I never felt like I had a full grasp over the fundamentals.

The reason, I believe, is that I never repeated what I read or got an overview of what I learned. By having a wiki, I can skim a subject and reiterate what I already know and put things into context whenever I stumble upon something new.

It might be the freshness but I feel like it will change my learning completely.

**#a-t-courses{{I need to stop collecting courses}}**

I went through my bookmarks and noticed that I had saved a 44 hour long #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}} playlist on learning vanilla JS. Then I had 400 hours of #a-t-courses{{Udemy}} courses, 18 #a-t-courses{{MasterClass}} courses, close to 100 books on art, 20 books on programming, thousands of #a-t-podcast{{podcast}} episodes and another few terabytes of miscellaneous.

It's such an easy habit of getting yet another book and believe that it will make you fluent or a master. In reality, you can't read yourself into becoming a musician. It's mainly about practice and I need to limit the gathering of future courses.

**I'm not missing cable at all**

I'm the kind of person that turned on the #a-t-tv-and-movies{{TV}} when I was heading for bed. Usually it was a so-so movie that I had seen before or it was a re-run of Big Bang Theory, American Dad or Family Guy. Something that would keep my occupied for a few minutes until it was time for commercial and then I went back to my phone. Basically going back and forth between these until it was in the middle of the night.

Unplugging cable forced me to make an active decision on what to play through my Chromecast. More often than not, there's genuinely nothing I want to watch. I still have the habit of turning on my TV but now it's usually on the Chromecast homescreen for 30 min before I just turn it off. It's still a work in progress.

**I finally found a working habit system**

I've tried apps, websites, bullet journal, clipboard with paperclips and a lot more but never lasted more than a few days. Usually I forgot about it for a few weeks, made a reset and lasted a few days before forgetting about it again.

This month, I created this: https://i.imgur.com/xX47za4.jpg

It's basically a piece of paper with my daily and weekly habits. It's hanging next to my bedroom door on a clipboard and every evening I take it down and check off what I did that day. The habit of going through the list has become a habit itself.

For the first time, I went through a full month of taking my vitamins, waking up early, making the bed, washing my face, turning off the computer before 22 and weighing myself. It's not a solution for everything though. I tried to implement daily exercise and eating that frog but never succeeded.

**#tech-track-time{{RescueTime}} doesn't know when VLC is productive**

My rule of thumb is that consuming is distracting and creating is productive. However, consuming courses isn't as bad as watching TV series. By using the same software, I have no idea how much time I spent watching entertainment and how much time I spent learning since it's all categorized as VLC (entertainment). It would probably be wise to use a dedicated software.

**I became more spontaneous**

Not difficult to improve from my current level but I had a tendency to decline joining friends with the excuse that I was tired or overworked. In reality, I was mainly comfortable with my sitcom, Discord, forum and a soda. When I blocked these things, It's greater than ever.#ben-more-social{{I became interested in joining anything}} because it triumphed my urge to watch yet another lecture.

#What I'll change for September

Overall I'm happy with the experience. You can argue that a wiki and my new habit system isn't really related to blocking unproductive sites but I disagree. The fact that I blocked sites made me snap out of my regular habits and forced me to "procrastinate" in new ways. Setting up a wiki is something I've thought about for years, but it wasn't until now that I actually took the time to do it.

What I'll try to improve upon:

* Try to complete all of my daily habits
* Have a dedicated box for my phone at home
* Better evening routine with a book and without TV
* Complete one major task (todo) every day

I'll also unblock Steam because I missed playing games but I need to stay more aware. I'll never reach 100% productivity anyway. Maybe some kind of daily limit to find a healthy balance.}}
