#post{{I realized that by posting about my journey, I might create unrealistic expectations.

People might read this, try this out and then **beat themselves down** for not being able to follow this.

In reality, it's not 38 days - it's more like 250 days, and 150 of them were failures.

Progress is on and off for everyone - it's normal. Sometimes it's one step forward, two steps back (or at least it seems like this).  

But I think it's important to:

1. #tech-slow-progress{{To keep trying and to see progress over a longer period of time (weeks? months? half a year is a good one)}}

2. Learn about yourself along the journey.   A friend of mine wrote about it recently: [https://www.ondrejmarkus.com/expert/](https://www.ondrejmarkus.com/expert/)

Good luck to all of you!}}




#title:{{Consuming cheap dopamine decreases my ability to handle stress and anxiety - 42/365 days of dopamine detox}} #permalink:/r/nosurf/comments/spxrg6/consuming_cheap_dopamine_decreases_my_ability_to/, #created:1644580650 

#post{{The usual explanation for why we ran towards addictive things is that we're unable to deal with stress.

I realized it's actually a two-way street... 

**Consuming cheap dopamine** (being in a state of laziness, feeling like a vegetable) =&gt; **#symp-less-able-to-deal-with-emotions{{makes are less able to deal with our emotions}}.**

and I think it's important to realize this because we're shooting ourselves in the foot. 

Because it looks like this:

Unable to deal with stress =&gt; Running towards distraction to not think about it =&gt; even less able to deal with stress because we tasted what being comfortable is

I have a good example to prove this:

As a hobby to fill out my free time, I picked up #other-activities-exercise{{rock climbing}}... I really like how social yet individual the activity is.

I'm still a noob, I fear heights, I've been doing this for 6 weeks now.

I was overwhelmed for a few days this week and I gave in one day and started reading news, watching videos - my usual poison. 

I actually went climbing the same day after doing this the whole afternoon.

So normally, it's uncomfortable for me to push further while climbing, but I can argue with myself.

**Usually, I would surf the wave of fear and enjoy the adrenaline, pushing forward.**

But now when I was climbing, I was having thoughts:

Why the hell am I doing this?  
What's the point of this?   
I just want to get back to the ground safely

**My brain wanted to be comfortable like it was the whole afternoon not having to work and just being entertained.**

But there is no progress in being comfortable!

So now I'm thinking about when it's okay to be comfortable and how to make sure it doesn't spread into other areas of my life

Any ideas? 

Thanks for reading this.}}




#title:{{Distracting ourselves is understandable, but it shouldn't be used as an excuse - 51/365 days of dopamine detox}} #permalink:/r/nosurf/comments/sx8nwy/distracting_ourselves_is_understandable_but_it/, #created:1645384009 

#post{{When I began my no surf journey, #bad-more-judgmental{{I was judgmental of myself and others spending so much time on the Internet.}}


More and more I understand why we seek these distractions:    
Life is hard,   
we have to deal with adversity,    
sh\*t happens,   
we have difficult decisions to make...    


And distractions help us escape from the stress caused by all that above.    


Yet, these distractions often become dangerous, and #symp-avoid-dealing-with-issues{{instead of addressing the causes of stress, we start to avoid it altogether}}.


**The distractions then serve as an excuse** \- I really need to do X, because I'm so stressed.  


I see there's something more to life when you stop running away from life by getting distracted. 

 It might be painful at first, but if we keep working on it and learn to deal with all the adversity, we unlock something.  

It's like you evolve to the next stage... You start living with intent and that's really worthwhile.

Good luck to all of you}}




#title:{{90/365 days of dopamine detox - Life is good}} #permalink:/r/nosurf/comments/tuls3v/90365_days_of_dopamine_detox_life_is_good/, #created:1648914219 

#post{{I started posting here about my journey on the 1st of January.

**After 90 days, I must say life is good.**

Why? Because thanks to dopamine detox, #ben-face-difficulties{{I stopped escaping}} and #ben-more-intentional{{started living with intent.}}

1. I lost interest in the things that don't matter.  
Previously, I would watch #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}} videos to numb myself, nowadays I only watch videos that help me accomplish things (guides, how-to) I'm working on.
2. I started facing my insecurities  
I'm honest with myself - my life is getting better and thanks to this upward trajectory I can handle negative things in my life... I can overcome them.

Thanks to these, I execute things I decide I want to change.

It's not always easy. I still get distracted from time to time, but I'm able to reset.

I recommend that everyone struggling with any form of dopamine addiction try doing a dopamine detox,

Mat.}}
