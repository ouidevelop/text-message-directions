#post{{Title. I'm a 21 year old college student who grew up in a very strict home. I did not have access to a phone or the internet outside of school until I was 17. Almost as soon as I got out and left for college 2 years ago, I spent 10 or more hours per day on average doom scrolling through #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}}, #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}}, or social media. Soon after, I was diagnosed with ADHD and made it my goal to cut down on screen time.
I toyed with the idea of trading in my iPhone for a flip phone. However, I need my smart phone to access Planet Fitness, school/work accounts, public electric vehicle charging stations, and various other things. So, I made it my goal to cut down on screen time and tested dozens of different strategies, productivity apps and browser extensions.   
What has worked for me personally:  
Laptop (MacBook):  
\- #tech-misc{{Disabled Safari, deleted Firefox and made Chrome my main browser. This was an important step since Chrome has more options for browser extensions, and erasing other browsers from my device prevents me from circumventing blocking extensions.}}
\- #tech-app{{one sec: This is an app I use on my phone as well. I purchased the premium version, which gives access one sec browser extensions for Safari and Chrome. When I try to open a distracting app (or website), it makes me wait for X number of seconds}}. Essentially, it makes logging into distracting apps/sites a pain in the ass. It isn't blocking software, but it makes logging into Facebook or Reddit out of boredom much less habit forming.
\- #tech-youtube-extension{{Used Unhook to only show content from channels I'm subscribed to. Since I still need to use YouTube for online classes and cannot realistically block it. I also disabled the search bar, Shorts, comments section and recommended videos.}}
\- #tech-grayscale{{Grayscale Filter (Chrome Extension)}}: Since colors are a big part of what gives you the dopamine rush from doom scrolling
\- #tech-blockers{{Opal: This is what I use to block social media websites from the browser. I leave it running at all times. The app itself works well, however, the caveat is that it only allows you to block certain websites from a pre-set list and will not work on other sites (ie. Crunchyroll, Yik Yak). However, it still works for most of the websites I want/need to block.}}
\- #tech-misc{{Limiting my laptop usage to work and productivity only, and keeping social media/distracting apps on my phone (with restrictions).}}
Phone (iOS):   
\- #tech-delete{{Deleted}} #a-t-tiktok{{TikTok}} and #a-t-youtube{{Youtube}}, keep YouTube in browser only.
\- one sec: Same as MacBook. Makes it harder to open distracting apps/websites.
\- #tech-accountability{{Forfeit: This is what I use to keep my screen time down. Basically, I have to upload a screenshot of my Screen Time report every day to prove that I spent less than 2 hours on my phone. The proof is manually reviewed and, if I fail for the day, the company charges $10 to my credit card.}} I have a similar system for making sure I go to the gym and work on coding-related things. Love the idea or hate it, this has been extremely helpful for me when it comes to breaking old habits and forming new ones.
\- #tech-grayscale{{Turned on grayscale filter (Accessibility)}}
Other things that have helped:  
\- #tech-misc{{Telling my friends about my goals}}. This goes for anything you want to accomplish. Getting others on your side makes it much easier to commit.
\- #tech-plan-time{{Scheduling activities/plans with friends ahead of time}}. Bonus points if you need to purchase a ticket or invite a friend. That way
\- #tech-do-other-things{{Hobbies}}. I cannot stress this one enough. If you don't have any, go out there and find something new. Learn a new skill. Find something you enjoy to replace screen time. For me, that was #other-activities-exercise{{working out, mountain biking and autocross}}.
\- I strongly recommend giving #book{{Atomic Habits}} by James Clear for any one struggling with doom scrolling
Overall, this sub has been a huge help to me. Breaking a social media/doom scrolling addiction is much more challenging than it's made out to be. It took me nearly a year and a half, which is probably longer than it takes for most other people. I probably spent well over $100 on productivity apps that I ended up deleting since 90% of them didn't work out for me. But, I can't say it wasn't worth it. Breaking my screen addiction has helped shape me into a #ben-being-a-better-person{{more interesting, well-rounded person}} and has given me #ben-more-time{{more time}} to focus on the things that are important to me. Overall, I would say that the most important thing is to be consistent every day, and #tech-slow-progress{{not give up. }}}}
