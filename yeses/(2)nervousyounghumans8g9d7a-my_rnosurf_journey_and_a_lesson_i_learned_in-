#post{{Hi everyone. This post is pretty long so there's a TL;DR at the bottom. It's also in two parts - the first is the story of my journey through internet addiction, but if you just want to read the important bits, skip down to "**The Realisation**".

**My Journey**

First, a bit about me. I'm a 21-year-old uni student studying my second degree. I'm single, unemployed, and clinically depressed and anxious. I'd say a fair few of you will be able to relate to that last bit. In any case, I'm the typical #a-t-reddit{{redditor.}}

I first noticed I had a problem with the internet back in 2012, in the middle of high school. We received laptops to use at school, and coming from a poor family, this was the first time I'd ever had access to a reliable internet connection. I went fucking nuts, as you can imagine for a sixteen year old - caught up on years worth of #a-t-youtube{{Youtube}}, #a-t-games{{played dumb flash games}} for hours, watched disturbing amounts of #a-t-porn{{porn}}; but it wasn't until I discovered Reddit that I truly started to have issues with my life. I became defensive when my mum questioned how much time I was spending on my computer. #symp-worse-school{{My grades started falling}} - previously an A+ student, I was now struggling to get Bs or even Cs. #symp-worse-sleep{{My sleep suffered}}; I'd regularly go to school on less than five hours of sleep and nap in a study room during breaks. But I still insisted I was fine. You can probably recognise this as typical in-denial addict behaviour.

Finally, two years later I found nosurf and woke up to how shitty my life had become and how awful it was that I was spending 7+ hours on the internet a day. I couldn't remember the last time I'd read a physical book. I was sleep-deprived, #symp-bad-health{{unhealthy, unfit}}, and #symp-worse-social-life{{my relationships with family were worsening because of how little I talked to them}}. #symp-less-memories{{I had an alarming lack of memories from the last two years of my life}} - it was all just a blur of porn and memes and useless info. Most of all, I remembered my internet-free childhood, how I’d spent hours reading, or writing, or painting, or playing music, and realised just how much I missed all of that.

#tech-deactivate/delete-account{{I deleted a few social media accounts}} - including Reddit - and started seriously #tech-track-time{{tracking my time}}. I managed to scrape together my grades to finish high school on a great note. And then holidays started. Guess what happened when I suddenly didn't have the terrifying pressure of schoolwork and deadlines? Correct - I fell right back into my crappy internet habits.

Now, I'm going to jump forward to 2016. Over the previous couple of years I’d had this cycle where I went on the internet less during uni times, but as soon as it was holidays or I had a day off, my internet use would soar. I was getting pretty good grades but was still often sleep-deprived, prone to napping during the day and missing lectures. I went on my phone a lot whenever I had spare time or was bored or upset or whatever. I drank three coffees a day because I was regularly staying up until 2 or 3 am.  

Then, in 2016, the unthinkable happened - I fell in love for the first time. We wound up dating for seven months and my life changed drastically. Not only was I using the internet less and less each day, sometimes going days without checkingReddit or #a-t-tumblr{{Tumblr}} or whatever else, but I felt *totally fine* not being on it. The basic thing I could pin it down to was that simply, I was really happy.

But it wasn’t perfect. Elsewhere, issues in my life began to surface. My partner caught onto this and begged me to see a therapist. I insisted I was fine, that I was okay, that there was nothing wrong with me, in much the same way I’d said I was fine back when I was spending 8+ hours a day online. I finally went to a doctor. I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety among other things. I went to therapy. 

By then we had broken up, which shattered me for a long time. I fell back into my internet habits, but this time it was different. This time, because of things I’d learned in therapy, because of all the times I’d tried to quit the internet and failed, I knew what was happening. And I knew what I had to do to get better.

**The Realisation**

Go anywhere online and you’ll find studies about how the internet makes you depressed. How it changes your brain, rewires it in such a way that you crave it, that without it you get upset and irrational, in the same way that a drug addict does without their fix. When I was initially trying to quit the internet back in 2014, I thought that if I simply restricted my online access, deleted social media apps, and tried to keep my usage down, then I would break the addiction and my life would be better. I see a lot of people on here talk about "downgrading" too, switching to worse phones and computers and deleting apps and the like.

For some people that might work, but for the vast majority it’s just not feasible in the long run. The problem is, it relies on the assumption that whoever is addicted to the internet would otherwise have a ‘happy’ or ‘good’ life that they can resume once the internet part is cut out. That it’s simple to replace ‘internet’ time with reading, or art, or study, or work, anything productive, and you’ll sleep more and be healthier and your life will be better and happier for it. 

You want to know a harsh truth? If you’re spending the majority of your waking life online, you’re probably not mentally healthy in the first place, and your life won’t get better like you think it will. 

You might be like me - it took years for me to get diagnosed and realise just how utterly, hopelessly depressed I was, internet or no internet. I had deep issues in my life that needed to be resolved. I was stuck doing things I didn’t enjoy, surrounded by toxic people I didn't like. I had bad social anxiety. Getting out of bed was impossible somedays. I hated being alone with my thoughts, especially at night. I was in a perfect spot for becoming addicted to the internet. And for some of you, this is probably what happened too. 

Cause here’s the thing. After years of trying – and failing – to stop using the internet so much, it took therapy and a shitload of self-awareness to realise just what was happening: 

**The internet doesn’t make you depressed – it just makes it really, *really* easy to not realise how depressed you already are.** It is literally the perfect tool for avoiding emotions that make you uncomfortable. Bored? Look at memes. Sad? Watch a funny video. Angry? Vent your frustration online or play games to calm down. Smartphones make this even worse – no matter where you are, whether on the train, or in a class, or waiting in line, the instant you feel an emotion that makes you uncomfortable, you can pick up your phone and distract yourself. Over time, this becomes a habit that is very hard to break. It gets to the point where when you feel even the slightest trace of boredom or sadness or whatever, you’re automatically reaching for the phone. 

This doesn’t just apply to people who are depressed. You could be a mentally healthy individual who goes through a bad breakup and starts bingeing Youtube late at night to avoid the loneliness. Maybe you’re not enjoying your classes so you start browsing Reddit during lectures. Maybe you're unemployed and don't know what to do with the spare time. But before long, it’ll become a habit that leaks into other aspects of your life; so that even when you’re doing something you would normally enjoy, like reading, if it doesn’t give you the instant gratification you’ve become used to then you’re likely to put the book down and browse stuff online. For many of us, this habit has become so ingrained over years that we don’t even pick up on what’s happening. 

I only realised this when I went to therapy. A large part of my recovery from depression and anxiety was recognising when I was feeling ‘negative’ emotions, reframing them in a way so that I wouldn’t be scared of them, and then using healthy ways to deal with them. Looking back on my history of internet addiction, it became extremely clear to me that my internet use always flared up during rough times. It happened when my best friend moved away in 2012. It happened when my dog passed away a few years ago. It happened when I went through my first breakup. It happened when I was really stressed or going through a depressive episode.

The thing is, actually feeling and processing those emotions is an incredibly important thing to do. Studies have shown that being bored is important because it allows your brain to start thinking and daydreaming, which boosts creativity. Emotions like anger and sadness are so important to recognise and deal with healthily because otherwise they can seriously impact your wellbeing. And if you’re depressed or anxious or chronically stressed, that is also an enormously important thing to realise because then you can take steps to improve your mental health. The emotional reactions you have to a situation are *vital* to realise because it tells you exactly what might be wrong with that situation. 

The internet prevents you from doing any of that. As an example, mindlessly browsing Reddit at two in the morning might make you feel marginally better in the short run, but the impact on your sleep and mood will make you feel shittier, and the cycle will repeat itself the next night when you’re in a crap mood and need a distraction to avoid those feelings. And on a deeper level, the internet prevents you from really analysing why you feel the need to stay up late on Reddit rather than sleep. Is it because you hate your job and don’t want to get up tomorrow? Because you’re lonely? Because you hate being alone with your own thoughts? Is it pure boredom? Do you worry that if you put down the phone you'll have to lie there for hours before falling asleep? 
No matter the reason, without giving ourselves time and space to pause and think *“hang on, why am I feeling so crap?”*, we can easily spend years stuck in jobs we hate, forgetting our passions, being surrounded by people we don't like, not indulging in hobbies that enrich your life, even being clinically depressed without treating it, until one day you wake up and wonder where your life went. I count myself incredibly fortunate - I lost the latter end of my teen years to the addiction and it’s taken a long time to break the habits, but I’m now so much more aware of my thoughts and weaknesses and my life is vastly better because of it. I still slip up sometimes, but I recognise when it's happening now and always make early steps to cut back on internet use.

**So how do you get better?** Well, every time you start reaching for your phone automatically, you pause, you breathe, you take notice of what you’re feeling, and then you sit with the emotion for a little while. More often than not, especially at the beginning, you will feel something like boredom, and it'll be uncomfortable. Focus on the emotion and give yourself enough time to recognise what you’re feeling, to recognise why you’re feeling that way, to accept it, and then to decide how you want to deal with it. It can be something as simple as “I feel bored” -&gt; “I feel bored because I’ve been in this lecture for ten minutes and haven’t checked my phone yet” -&gt; “Now that I’ve recognised that boredom I’m going to make a conscious effort to accept the feeling and continue focusing on the lecture anyway. I’ll check my phone in half an hour.”

Over time, this process will become easier. When I first started I was hopeless at recognising what I was feeling, but after months of practising I now almost immediately know what I’m feeling and why I’m feeling it, and think of a healthy way to deal with it. Doing this will also help break the very real habit of internet addiction, since you’re not caving into the instinct of checking it whenever you’re bored. 

In summary, realising exactly why I got addicted to the internet has helped me more than any time-tracking tool or turning off wifi or simply trying to cut out internet ever did. I’m sharing this because I feel like there are probably a lot of people out there who can relate to my story – whether you’re mentally ill without realising it like I was, whether you just cave into distractions too often, or whether you’re just someone who gets bored and browses stuff. For some of you, getting better will involve going to therapy, taking medication, and taking big steps to improve your life. For others it will be as simple as practising the above advice, and over time it will get easier and you’ll feel less compelled to go online. 

I know this was very long but I really hope that by telling my story it’ll help some of you. I definitely know I wish someone had told me about this years ago. Lastly, if you think you might be clinically depressed, please seek professional help. I cannot emphasise how much it changed my life for the better. Thank you for reading.

**TL;DR:** I tried - and failed - for years to beat my internet addiction but nothing stuck until I learned some things in therapy and realised: simply "quitting" the internet is not going to work for a lot of people. This is because for many of us, whether you're clinically depressed or a bored office worker, the internet itself isn't the problem - but it *is* the perfect tool for avoiding "negative" or "uncomfortable" emotions like boredom or sadness, and distracting you from issues in your life. #tech-misc{{The key to beating internet addiction involves pausing when you feel the urge to be online, becoming aware of what you're really feeling and/or avoiding, accepting that emotion for what it is, and then deciding on a healthy way to deal with it.}} Over time this process will get easier, the habit of mindlessly browsing the internet will weaken, and you'll find yourself automatically reaching for your phone a lot less. Let yourself be bored. Let yourself be sad. Replace ignoring the emotion through the internet with something healthier, like writing about it in a journal, talking to someone you trust, or getting professional help (if you need it). This is what's helped me most in my journey to beat internet addiction, and I hope it helps you too.

Edit: I am floored by the reaction to this post. If anyone ever wants to talk further I am more than happy. Also, a huge thank you to whoever gave me gold. I’m incredibly humbled to know I’ve helped some of you that much. }}




#title:{{How my relationships have changed since starting nosurf, both for the better and worse}} #permalink:/r/nosurf/comments/8nj692/how_my_relationships_have_changed_since_starting/, #created:1527779416

#post{{So, about a month ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/8g9d7a/my_rnosurf_journey_and_a_lesson_i_learned_in/), which was surprisingly popular. I'm pleased to say that since then my nosurf journey has only improved, and I'm now at the stage where I no longer crave the internet and don't feel antsy when I haven't checked my phone in a while.

Anyway, with my phone usage being even less recently, I've really started to notice just how different it is interacting with people when I'm not on my phone a lot - and not just with friends and family, but also with people in public spaces, like shopping centres and on public transport. 

This might be surprising, but honestly, it's a weird, lonely world sometimes. #right-mind{{I never realised it as much when I spent a lot of time on my phone during what I call "in-between" places - the places when you're going somewhere, like public transport or sidewalks - but it can be a profoundly isolating experience to be sitting on a train and see everyone else looking down at their phones, or to be walking behind someone who keeps slowing down because they're texting. Sadly, this extends to close relationships too - it only really hits you when you're no longer addicted to your phone just how damn addicted everyone else is.}} Multiple times I've been sitting among a group of friends and as soon as the conversation dwindles, they all pull out their phones just to check for notifications they already know they don't have.

#ben-better-social-life{{But in many more ways, my relationships have improved so much}}. I feel a lot closer to my family, because we talk and I actually listen without simultaneously browsing facebook on my phone. Likewise with my friends - it's so much more enjoyable to sit down with a friend and actually talk and laugh without either of us being distracted by our phones. Also, I've made some new friends - voluntarily, even - because when you're looking up and around, it's so much easier to connect with people.

This is a topic I thought I'd write about because I see a lot of posts about personal improvement here (which is great), but I don't see that many about what it's like socially after moving into a post-Internet addiction life. It's certainly been an interesting journey, and I'm absolutely glad that I decided to do it.}}
