#post{{ About seven years back, an adorable game was making the rounds on social media. Ten questions to ask your child about you. Our five-year-old answered “what is your mom good at?” She knew this one immediately: “texting on her phone.” Then: “what is your mom not good at?” “Not texting on her phone.” I awkwardly laughed thinking it wasn't that clever. Yet later when alone, I sobbed.

At the age of five, our daughter had identified my addiction. #symp-shame{{I felt deep shame}}. #symp-less-self-controll{{I was powerless to control my social media use and my texting}}. Life had become unmanageable as #symp-worse-sleep{{I stayed up well past midnight, sometimes all night posting and commenting on social media}}. I’d wake up with next-to-no sleep exhausted. Even though I was the stay-at-home mom, my husband handled the entire morning routine getting the kids out the door.

I searched weekly for a support group and #tech-support-group{{in June of 2020 I found ITAA. “These are MY PEOPLE,” I declared to my husband after the first meeting. I was so very happy to have finally found this fellowship which has become a home to me the last 2 ½ years.}}

I went to a meeting every day from there forward. Yet, nothing changed, and I didn’t get sober. There’s a recovery slogan: “meeting makers make it,” well, meeting makers who \*only\* go to meetings, don’t. In January of 2021, I really started to work the program. I got a sponsor and began the steps. I made outreach calls. I love ITAA’s outreach calls: if I need support in the moment, I ask and someone calls me. Likewise, I can support another.

My early bottom lines—the specific tech boundaries I use to define sobriety—were around limiting my use: such as only using before 10pm or only going on to social media to visit the district parents’ group. Yet I slipped. Again and again. #symp-feel-bad{{I wasn’t happy}} and I certainly wasn’t sober. My usage was very unmanageable, and self-reliance had failed me.

On September 27, 2021, I hit my bottom. That is my wedding anniversary and my husband stayed home from work. He was doing some yard work and then we’d planned to ride our Harley north and have lunch. He finished the yard work. I could tell he was done but I couldn’t pull myself away from social media. Almost an hour later I pulled myself away—we had a rushed lunch to get back for the kids—this was my fault. That evening we had a special dinner to celebrate our anniversary with the kids. Once again, I couldn’t pull myself off social media and didn’t join until dessert.

#symp-negative-self-image{{I felt like SUCH a bad mom.}} Who does this?!

I was running my life on self-will and I needed to trust something other than myself.

I had a lot of fear and mourning around leaving social media. Yet another ITAA fellow let me know that he had felt that, too. That helped me feel like I could do it and my ITAA friends gave me support.

Yet I can’t stay sober today because of yesterday's recovery. I need to ask for help every day. As I’ve been in the program longer, I’ve discovered new bottom lines. Toughest for me today is over-researching insignificant purchases but I’m working on that with an #tech-accountability{{accountability group}} of six ITAA friends who have similar issues.

I’ve been quite active in service with the fellowship. I’m excited that we’re so new--only five years. It is a great honor to help create this fellowship which I have craved for years. The camaraderie, support, and love I feel in this fellowship lifts me up daily.}}
