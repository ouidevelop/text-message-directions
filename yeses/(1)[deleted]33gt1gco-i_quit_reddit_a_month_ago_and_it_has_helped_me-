#post{{I don't have an Instagram account, no snap, not very active on fb, this was my poison. This was my source of dopamine. This was my source of #symp-misc{{daily aggravation}}, #symp-misc{{confrontation}}, #symp-misc{{narcissism}} and #symp-misc{{toxicity.}}

I'm currently at the tail end of my ten-day quarantine before I can start my job in another country, thus bored stiff and unfortunately quite wasted, there is no other way I would have made a new account. But I will not visit the subs I used to, I just wanted to get this off my chest.

#tech-deactivate/delete-account{{You all just need to delete your accounts}}. #ben-battery-life{{The battery on my phone lasts for a week now}}, #other-activities-exercise{{if it wasn't for those 30-mile bikerides when I listen to audible}}. #other-activities-cook{{I fucking cook now.}} I cook complicated foreign cuisine when I used to have trouble boiling an egg and it was never quick enough because I needed to get back on the couch to hook up to the screen. I make cheesecakes for my kids that I don't eat any of, because I kicked my sugar habit (well I'm wasted now so I had some candy that I was supposed to take to the office next week, I'm only human and besides, I've #ben-lost-weight{{lost 10 pounds}} after kicking Reddit).

#ben-better-reading-writing{{I can read a book, I couldn't}}. #ben-productive{{The things I can work on my house in a day, took a week before, always a reason to pull up my phone for a "reward" after 15 minutes of activity}}. #other-activities-misc{{I built a treehouse for my kids}} that is incomparable to pretty much any in my town for sure.

It's probably watching Alex Becker that made me realize how our brain works, I quit caffeine in march but it wasn't enough, dropping this shit was.

And no, kicking Reddit doesn't make me a superhuman or better than anyone else. It just enables me to function as a normal 37yo male, not an addict to the screen that provides nothing. So if you've found your way to this sub, you already know what needs to be done next.}}
