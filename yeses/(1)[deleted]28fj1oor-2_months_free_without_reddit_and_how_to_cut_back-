#post{{Ever since, I made a commitment to myself to spend less time on the internet, I have:

\- Cut down on time on the internet from 5-6 to 2-3 hours.

\- Got off of reddit (When I realized reddit was exactly like that one pretentious guy at school who made the same jokes over and over, I ditched it. ) (I'm only have it now if I ever want to do an AMA if I get famous or something)

\- #tech-delete{{Got rid of any apps that weren't beneficial to myself}} (I only have: Youtube for posting videos, Snapchat for talking to people, and Samsung messages for talking to people with no Snapchat)

\- #ben-feel-better{{Feel way happier}}

\-#ben-productive{{Way more productive}}

\- #ben-less-procrastination{{Procrastinate less}}

\- Better mental health

\- #ben-better-physical-health{{Better general physical health}}

\- #ben-better-eye-health{{Less strain on my eyes}}

\- #tech-unsubscribe{{Got rid of over 200 #a-t-youtube{{youtube}} channels}}

\- Other stuff I can't think of.

Doing all of this requires dedication and accountability as well as a change of mind.

Ask yourself, is staring at a screen, scrolling mindlessly at posts, and earning karma that is influenced the first couple of votes;

is this what I want to do for the rest of my life?

Is this how I want to be remembered for? What could I be doing now?

Once you change your mind, you change everything.

You could track your time, ask everyone for help, set app timers, etc.

But if you don't change your mind, everything will eventually be futile.

&amp;#x200B;

My ultimate goal in the future is to only go on the internet if I search something that is absolutely important to know.

Ignore the mindless urges like "I wonder what German stormtroopers look like", because you're going to forget it anyways.

Otherwise I just focus on my hobbies, read some books here and there, and just enjoy life in general.

You only have one life, every minute counts. How will you live it?
