I was addicted to the Internet.  

It was a problem - #symp-less-real-friends{{I was losing friends}}, #symp-worse-social-life{{missing out on social opportunities}}, #symp-worse-school{{failing classes.}} My screen-time was out of control.

#symp-worse-sleep{{I wasn't getting enough sleep}} #symp-feel-bad{{which was caused my mental health to slide}}. #symp-bad-health{{My overall health}} and #symp-worse-social-skills{{social skills suffered hugely}} because of my addiction to the Internet. I was hugely invested in a #a-t-games{{few online games}} as well as #a-t-reddit{{reddit}} and #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}}.

Continuing like this was not sustainable for my well-being and I only realized this as I was halfway through university.

So over the past couple of years, I decided I need to change something.  

1. 1. #tech-track-time{{I began putting a heavy focus on monitoring the hours I was spending on a screen}}. Reducing my ability to get in front of a screen truly helped quit the addiction. Putting it all in perspective helps with this, for example, 6 hours online is 4 hours out of your day.
2. 2. #tech-do-other-things{{I replaced my screen-time with hobbies and new, fulfilling activities}}. I took up cooking and reading to replace my screen-time. Both are life-enhancing skills that make you happy and completely rewarding.
3. 3. #tech-delete{{I eventually deleted and got rid of all the apps}} and stop visiting the websites that had me addicted. These apps/websites are purposefully designed to be addicting as possible which is why I recommend just deleting them altogether since they are so hard to quit.  I stopped checking the reddit front page. Deleted Instagram. Turned off notifications, etc. (I have a whole list of hidden tips that I used to make this transition easy).

I really hope this can help some people start beginning the journey to a more 'nosurf' lifestyle.
