#post{{I stopped watching TV 10 years ago. I watch more #a-t-youtube{{video}} over the internet now than I ever did before. #ben-better-social-life{{I have been more social}} and #ben-more-active{{done way more things}} that I would have if I had been lost on #a-t-reddit{{reddit}} or #a-t-wikipedia{{Wikipedia}} or Documentaries. I thought if I was learning something that I wasn't wasting my time. Collecting information and not doing anything with it is a #symp-wasted-time{{total waste of time.}}

I am done learning things. I want to start doing them more. I am thinking about having every other day be Amish day.

Biggest Shocker (This is hard to believe but it is true)
I was addicted to the YouTube suggestions physically, I have a strong tolerance for drugs I have tried them all except crack and heroin I have never been addicted to anything except Crystal Meth (That was way worse btw stay away from the white devil)   I had physical withdrawals when I stopped watching YouTube #withdrawal-time{{after the 3rd day}} #withdrawal-misc{{it was just like coming off of Pain Killers when would get high for too many days in a row that with them a few years back, I am going to a strict church so I don‚Äôt do drugs right now other than pot üòä. Trust me my wife witnessed it.  I couldn‚Äôt believe how bad it was. I have had to come off of Pain killers before this was way way worse. }}
After taking a month off #tech-curate-content{{I let myself watch only subscribed videos}} #tech-youtube-extension{{I still use a Chrome addon that Blocks the suggestion AI}}


Thank you r/nosurf! you all were a big part of my recovery!

I have a different definition of addiction than most BTW. For me it is not being able to stop something when you want to. I believe that I am the only person that can decide wither or not I am addicted to something. I am not talking about others opinions here only my own. My x-wife would say that I am addicted to pot. I see it as it's something that I like to do sometimes.    }}
