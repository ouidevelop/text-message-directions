#post{{Last year I #tech-delete{{deleted all my social media}} and it's the best decision I've ever made. Social media was taking up so much of my time. I would be mindlessly scrolling through my news feed for hours, and any time I would feel any boredom creeping in I would pop out my phone and start checking my social media. #ben-productive{{However, now I find myself being more productive}} and #ben-feel-better{{even more happier}} and #ben-less-angry{{less angry}}. Before I would be scrolling through social media and be angry with what I saw, Trump, Brexit, #ben-less-comparing{{seeing pictures of people doing great things with their lives}} etc, but I no longer feel that way anymore. I'm glad I quit. }}

#post{{I’ve gone nearly 5 months without any social media (apart from #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}}, #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}} and #a-t-quora{{Quora}}). It’s been a great experience. My life is so much better now. Of course all my problems haven’t disappeared by deleting social media, but a great deal of it has. You know that scene in the movie limitless where Eddie (Bradley Cooper) takes the NZT drug for the first time, and when he swallows the pill he says “I was blind but now I see.” Well yeah, that’s how I feel. It might sound like I’m exaggerating lol but #ben-clear-mind{{everything in my life is so much more clearer}}. I never imagined living a life outside of social media, but I am now and it’s great. }}
