#post{{So I struggled for a while doing the popular suggestions, and I finally feel like I'm free from a lot of the shitty things about surfing. 

I still spend a little time on #a-t-reddit{{reddit}} and #a-t-tumblr{{tumblr}}, but it's usually less than 30 minutes. I watch some #a-t-youtube{{youtube}} but that's mostly music or video essays I particularly like.

The biggest step was getting a #tech-dumbphone{{dumb phone}}. I still #tech-delete{{keep my smartphone at home, but void of browsers, youtube, social media, and most games}} (cookie clicker takes next to no time and I remember to check it every week or so). It mostly holds banking apps like my mobile bank, paypal, venmo, ect along with health apps like mychart and a mood tracker. I use it for maybe 10-15 minutes a day. Meanwhile, the dumbphone lets my family and friends talk to me when they need to. I have a Kaios phone so it still has whatsapp for international friends and a basic maps, in case of emergency.

A #tech-other-time-checking{{wristwatch}} and #tech-misc{{a planner}} also made such a big difference. I don't need a phone to check the time, and the watch was like 20 bucks and it's waterproof. The planner replaced google calendar and was actually WAY better for me, bc I could see more clearly the plans I had.

I do have a paperwhite nook. #other-activities-read{{I read SO MUCH on it}}, and the lack of light doesn't keep me up. The thing just reads. And I download books...less than legally, so it doesn't go online at all. NOT that I would EVER advocate piracy though...

I work as a CNA and not agency, so there's no need to have a phone for work. And to be honest, I don't think I'd want to work somewhere that required me to have a smartphone. #ben-freedom{{I value the freedom too much}}. #bad-difficulties-with-others{{Peers and my wife kinda act weird about it}}, but honestly, that's fine. #ben-feel-better{{I feel so much more happy to be without social media}} and scrolling, staring endlessly at sisyphus's glowing rectangle.}}
