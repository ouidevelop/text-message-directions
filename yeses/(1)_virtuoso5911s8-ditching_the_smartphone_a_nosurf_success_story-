#post{{So about 6 months ago, #tech-broken-phone{{I threw my iPhone as hard as I could against my wall, and shattered the screen}}.  The phone didn't break completely.  The phone was still on, as the cracked screen was jolting out spurts of electronic light through the spiderweb of shattered glass.  It was like an insect still kicking reflexively after being smashed.  I put it out of it's misery, but grabbing it on each end and bending it until it's insides snapped up and the phone shut off for good.

Then I went in to work.

I got off work, and instead of checking my phone for notifications, news, social media posts, text messages, emails, and calls, I just walked out of the restaurant and walked around in the physical world and experienced a #ben-being-present{{feeling of presence and stimulation that I had completely forgotten about}}.  It was #ben-misc{{like being a child in an open field, exploring the world without being tethered to the concerns of adult life}}.  #ben-being-present{{Seeing things and thinking about them, being present in the moment, enjoying the world as it is}}.

#tech-no-phone{{I went without a cell phone for nearly two months}}.  It was glorious.  People simply couldn't bother me.  I indulged in the intense isolation that we systematically deny ourselves in this constantly connected world.  #other-activities-read{{I read books on park benches}}, #other-activities-walk{{I walked around with coffee in hand}}, #other-activities-misc{{observing human behavior up close and personal}}, rather than through an artificial medium where people filter their words and facial expressions, custom tailoring their image to please the greatest amount of people.

I ended up caving in to the social pressure to have a cell phone, but #tech-dumbphone{{I got a very simple GoPhone that I use for calls and texts and nothing else whatsoever.}}

I felt it was somewhat irresponsible to be completely unreachable, in case of family emergencies and things of that nature.  

But overall, my relationship with my phone has stayed extremely minimal, so I've retained the benefits of destroying the smartphone.

I'm not going to sit here and lie and pretend like my life is so great because I killed my smartphone.  I still have tons of issues to work on.  

But life is better.  Because when those problems become too much, I can simply take a walk and escape them all, if only for a little while.  

#ben-being-present{{Every day I feel present}}.  #ben-clear-mind{{I feel lucid}}.  #ben-appreciate-more{{The world is vibrant and interesting.}}

I no longer occupy myself with the daily news.  Being up to date on everything constantly is not only unnecessary; it is destructive to our well being.  There is so much going awry in the world at any given moment that keeping a constant newsfeed means that we are #symp-misc{{inundated with negativity}} and #symp-horror{{horror.}}

But this is a choice we make.  #ben-misc{{I made the choice to reclaim my psychological independence, at least to a degree}}.  and it's been positively wonderful.

Cheers.}}
