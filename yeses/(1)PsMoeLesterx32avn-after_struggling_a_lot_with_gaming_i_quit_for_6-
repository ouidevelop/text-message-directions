#post{{Hi all, this post is just to give my review of quitting #a-t-games{{gaming}} for 6 months.

Why did I do it? Because my powerful computer was needed by a family member for their graphic design requirements, and to save money I willingly #tech-remove-devices{{gave the computer to them (different houses) so I'd not see that computer again.}}

Quitting gaming was lifechanging, and very difficult at first. #withdrawal-bored{{I was bored}} #withdrawal-time{{for months}} after the initial quitting, but that boredom pushed me to do greater things eventually. Of course I can't just let go of all that fun and dopamine-induced activity called gaming, so I #tech-misc{{replaced it with binge-watching #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}} and browsing #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}}.}}

However, this is a hugely better alternative compared to gaming, as I'd get bored fast of these activites and won't spend hours on the computer. I'll seek to do more things, and the best thing is I can actually pause and not have to continue my activity. I can go to dinners without thinking of gaming, #ben-more-time{{I have more time}} to #other-activities-exercise{{workout}} because I'm not hopelessly glued to the computer, #ben-more-motivation{{I have more motivation to do more things.}}

#ben-lost-weight{{I have lost 5kgs so far and added a lot of muscle through consistent workouts}}, #other-activities-misc{{got into golf}} and #ben-made-friends{{made a lot of friends}} through that, #other-activities-go-out{{and more invested in the partying scene}} because I am actually motivated to go now and meet friends. #ben-better-social-life{{I also hit up more friends to hangout, rather than waiting for them to ask because I'm gaming so much}}. #ben-productive{{More focused at work too, because I don't procrastinate searching for the best builds or best tactics for climbing.}}

**TL;DR: All-in-all, net positive. Replaced gaming with browsing and binge-watching, but gained so much more energy for other activities.**}}
