#post{{It’s been 1 month since #tech-youtube-extension{{I installed the plugins for #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}}[from comments: Unhook, return dislike, shorts blocker, remove end cards and click bait remover]}} that literally neutered it. No more clickbaits, recommendations or shorts. It looks empty and boring and doesn’t display a thing unless you type something in a search bar.
At first my idea was to quit using YouTube once and for all but that turned out to be unrealistic since my study process depends greatly on explanation videos from YT. So the less painful option was taken.
Along with installing plugins #tech-rules{{I decided to myself that I’ll watch either explanatory content or podcasts on scientific topics that are both long and thought provoking.}}
#withdrawal-time{{First week}} was very unpleasant. #withdrawal-bored{{I was bored most of the time.}} #withdrawal-misc{{I couldn’t work properly as if I forgot how to concentrate on tasks.}} #withdrawal-misc{{Each time I had a meal I felt emptiness and my food didn’t interest me as much}} but then I started noticing small changes that became more visible over time

1. #ben-productive{{Once I quit binging YT I suddenly started caring more about my work and studies}} as if YouTube was my painkiller and escape at the same time. It robbed me of my urge to live.
2. #withdrawal-urges{{I experienced urges to watch random video when I’m bored or have a task that I don’t particularly know how to solve}}
3. I also used to watch YT prior to solving hard tasks from work to ease my anxiety at the beginning. Now I only have to plan my work routine to avoid feelings of unease 
4. #ben-better-social-skills{{My speech became better and I started to notice more social cues}}
5. #ben-more-learning{{I actually learn new things now instead of imagining how I would.}}
6. #ben-more-time{{I have more free time}}
7. I understood the exact meaning of attention economy.

Media from a useful tool became an addiction. I won’t accept this state of things in my life and it this point I feel like I could pay YouTube itself to provide me with a purified version of media if they had it. 
But since it does not exist I will donate to all the chrome extension makers whose products I use. Yeah, I’m salty. You don’t sell my natural curiosity to some ad makers.

Also, despite all the actions I took I still suffer from information overload and it really feels like my filtering measures only made my issues worse.

As if racing through countless political videos and let’s plays is less mentally taxing than watching one podcast of the same length. I don’t get it. At least I have more free time now to process my thoughts, to study new things. I believe that I simply unlearned how to consume and process limited quantities of information but I guess I’ll see and share how it unfolds in the long run.}}
