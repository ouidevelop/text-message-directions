#post{{About a month ago I told how I was done with my browsing and screentime habits. I made about &amp;gt;8 hours screentime, I said. Actually it was close to 12 hours. And I am really bad at self discipline. So I let some apps help me. 

- #tech-blocker-freedom{{I used Freedom to prevent myself from endless news scrolling}}, social media checking and getting lost at other sites by creating time frames and blocklists. It isnâ€™t free, but it is cross platform (Windows / Mac / iOS / Android) and can be used to block out apps / browsers too.

- I used #tech-blocker-stayfocusd{{stayfocusâ€™d in chrome for desktop}} to prevent myself from endless editing settings in chrome extensions, and put a limit on some sites in desktop

- I use the #tech-blocker-forest{{forest app}} in chrome for desktop , for sites that I want to use for a bit, but not every five minutes. Same for my phone and tablet, but then for not using it at all. If thereâ€™s no real reason to stay away from my phone, I set the time limit to short and let it count on after I passed it. When I look at it, I think: nah - no need to break that right now.

- I use #tech-blocker-screentime{{screentime on my iPhone and iPad to remind myself what is enough time}}. But I rarely reach the limit.

My current average / week is less than 2.5 hours / day. Intending to keep it that way. Iâ€™ll do this. Even my BF is starting to change his own surfing behavior ðŸ˜….

Maybe this is extreme for some. But I needed it.}}
