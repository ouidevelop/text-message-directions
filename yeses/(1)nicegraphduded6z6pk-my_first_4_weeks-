#post{{It has been roughly 4 weeks since I began no surf(more like less surf for me). #tech-rules{{My rules for this time}} have been as follows

1. No social media or phone based entertainment until at least 2:30 PM 
2. No social media or phone based entertainment at all on Sundays
3. No social media or phone based entertainment until after all classes for the day are done. 
4. Sleep with my phone in another room (requires alternative alarm) 
5. No phone usage until after breakfast 
6. Computer and tablet are exclusively used for work and school related tasks. 
7. #tech-phone-break{{Leave phone in the car when I go to the gym}} (unless I'm meeting with someone and I can see they aren't inside yet)
8. No phone during class (duh) 
9. #tech-unsubscribe{{Only follow channels and subreddits that provide me with value and don't suck me in.}}




What's the hardest part? 

The hardest one for me is certainly doing a complete social media fast on Sundays. Usually sunday is my least busy day so I'm prone to #bad-bored{{boredom}} and I've slipped up on this one at least twice, but it's the only one I've slipped up on more than once.


What's the easiest part?

I have absolutely no trouble leaving my phone in the car at the gym. #ben-better-attention{{It's fantastic how much more focused I feel}} and how it gives my mind a break.

What's changed? 

My phone usage has gone down from a typical 4 hours a day on weekdays and 7-8 hours a day on weekends to 1-2 hours a day on weekdays and 2-3 hours a day on weekends. On top of that my usage which used to be primarily #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}} and #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}} has changed to being mostly useful apps like Amazon kindle, Dayboom (journaling app), navigation, email, and texting. I still use and enjoy YouTube and Reddit but my usage is less than 10 minutes a day on average for each.

#ben-more-time{{With the newfound free time}} #other-activities-read{{I've started reading books for pleasure for the first time....ever really.}} I've also picked up a couple of old hobbies again for when I'm bored around the house (to do when I get the urge to surf). #ben-better-school{{Most importantly I've been more on top of my course work this semester than ever before.}} I haven't stayed up late studying or working on something since I started this and I find it easier to focus for longer periods of time than I used to.


I'm well aware the 4 weeks isn't really all that long considering I've been addicted to technology for over 10 years. #ben-more-positive{{I just feel hopeful now in a way that I haven't before}} because I finally managed to change my behavior for longer than a day.

I realize that nothing I listed in revolutionary, but I wanted to share. The biggest one for me is waiting until 2:30 to use social media. It primes the brain for novelty to wake up and hop on reddit or ig so not doing it helps me immensely with concentration.}}
