#post{{I'm writing this post in hopes that it'll bring some serious motivation to you guys. I know how hard it is to start doing something about your addiction, like actually taking necessary steps, and I must say, #tech-nosurf{{finding this subreddit last fall really cut the final cord for me.}}

When I read my diaries from back when I was 19 years old, the word "internet addiction" is already a part of my vocabulary. Which means that I've been aware that I do have a problem with the internet for 11 (!!) years until I finally managed to deal with it in a mature, responsible way. #tech-accept-problem{{Until I finally admitted to myself that this is an addiction that has to be taken just as serious as any other addiction out there}} \- drug addiction, alcohol addiction, you name it. I know how hard it is for the brain to understand that \- because it's *just* the internet, right, anyone uses it every single day of their lives, so what's the big harm?

But it is. Because if you spend the entirety of your 20s sitting in your bed in front of a computer screen, if being a hermit and being lonely has become your "normal" and, even worse, if you started telling yourself that you are okay with this lifestyle, if you are "proud" how well you get along with just yourself, and if all this results in being unkissed, a virgin, single and depressed once you enter your 30s \- then you start to realize that it's not "just the internet". It is a decease, an addiction, something is off in your brain that has to be fixed.

But now the good news, and the hopefully motivating part of this post:

When I decided, "enough is enough!" last fall, #tech-use-outside-internet{{I removed my home internet for no less than 6 weeks}}. #withdrawal-anxiety{{I remember how panicked I was in the beginning}}, and really concerned about how I would fill my days, especially since I was unemployed at that time, too, and how even going for 3 days without internet seemed nearly impossible to me.

But I did it. I went through with it, yes, with a few relapses, but all in all, I had 6 weeks of a completely new life, leaving the comfort of my bed, leaving the comfort of the virtual world, finding an entirely unexpected new comfort: #ben-being-present{{The comfort of being present in the real world}}. #ben-contemplation{{The comfort of just lying in my bed doing nothing but letting my thoughts wander, letting them just *be* whatever they were, without acting upon them}}. The comfort of owning a monthly pass to the local swimming pool riding my bike there several times a week to go for a swim whenever I felt the urge to go online again. #tech-do-other-things{{*Distraction* really is the key component to getting over an internet addiction. The minute you feel like you wanna go surf, go do something else.}} Something that takes a bit of time, like riding your bike or #other-activities-go-out{{visiting the library or visiting another place in your city you like. I even once went to the cinema in the afternoon all by myself.}}

And you know what the greatest part about these 6 weeks were? That literally after only 3 weeks of this new life, I started noticing some mind\-blowing changes in how I felt on a day to day basis. 

3 weeks! After 13 years of being addicted, it took only 3 weeks without the internet to notice that I was finally getting better! That things were changing! That my brain was changing!

I had never ever expected it to go this fast, I really thought it would take me months until I would notice something. But, 3 weeks only it was. Which is NOTHING compared to 13 YEARS of addiction and nothing compared to the rest of my life, hopefully another 50 years! 3 weeks. Let that sink in, you guys, if you are serious about getting over this, and go cold turkey, it might not even be such a hard thing to do because of how fast you will feel real progress.

#ben-feel-better{{What you will feel after those 3 weeks is best described as unexpected waves of happiness}}. You are walking to the grocery store just to buy some food and suddenly a rush of happiness flows through your body. You have no idea where it comes from, there is no reason to be particularly happy right now, but still, there it is, right inside your body, and you suddenly realize: This is how life is supposed to feel. This is how I used to feel *before* I got addicted. And with time, another thing will happen, and that is, that #ben-feel-like-yourself{{you will truly feel like yourself again}}. #ben-more-self-esteem{{And that you will finally, after all these years, be in love with this feeling, in love with being yourself again.}} Because all the #symp-regret{{regret}}, the #symp-misc{{anger}}, #symp-misc{{the frustration}} that you felt every damn night after yet another day binge\-browsing the internet, all these feelings will be suddenly gone. 3 weeks.

I want to paraphrase /u/ohdearohmyohmy who described this feeling of being yourself again once so well: It's like being settled in your own skin again, the way it felt to just BE before life made its tragic and exhausting aspects known to you.

#ben-being-present{{To just be.}}

I wish you guys all the motivation it takes to finally change your life. What I can say with absolute certainty is this:

You won't regret it.

Not for a single day.}}
