#post{{20 y/o. Five months ago I decided to quit the internet completly. No smartphone, computer or anything else that connects me to the internet. The four months were hard I‘d say, especially if you have online class. I couldn’t imagine to return. The digital world has so less to offer, once you realise that. Retrospective I regret the #symp-wasted-time{{lost time}}, but that‘s life, you learn. Btw I‘m using my brothers phone right now to update. Ask me any questions. See ya}}
