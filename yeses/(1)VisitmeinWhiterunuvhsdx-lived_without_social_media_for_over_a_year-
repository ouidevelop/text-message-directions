#post{{About a year ago, I thought the happiest feeling ever was laying in bed an browsing #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}} and #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}}. Then I decided to delete almost all of my accounts. Here are my honest results.

It did not completely changed my life. #ben-feel-better{{I felt really happy}} when the #tech-deactivate/delete-account{{accounts were deleted}}, but after that life just went on as it always had (except that the world was on fire with Covid but let's leave that there). I didn't feel more stable or anxious at first, but over time, I started feeling subtle benefits of not having that online presence any more:

1. There is not the burden of keeping up with everything: I used to get anxious about posts to like, comments to react to and messages that needed answering. If I have answered my Whatsapp-messages and responded to any missed phone calls, my online social duty is done. I keep a strict timeslot of 10 minutes daily for Whatsapp. If it's important, people will call. 
2. #ben-more-time{{There is a lot more time for other stuff}}: I think my comfortable Instagram lay-ins were somewhat nice, but waking up from my screen after two hours of viewing things I could not even remember always felt really wasteful. I do enjoy the extra time that goes into reading and writing.
3. #ben-better-sleep{{No more broken nights}}: There is something really nice about an infinite source of entertainment while in bed. So nice that it gets creepy because it seems you cannot stop. I sometimes still struggle with this and read every news article I can find on my phone. Even if it doesn't interest me at all. I try to leave my phone outside my bed area, but as we all do, sometimes we decide to do it anyway.

In conclusion, I would definitely recommend it. Deleting social media will not leave you isolated, I still have a lot of friends and I don't feel I'm missing out on important stuff. It will not solve mental health issues, because it's not that simple, but if you take the time you will notice subtle plusses from this lifestyle.}}
