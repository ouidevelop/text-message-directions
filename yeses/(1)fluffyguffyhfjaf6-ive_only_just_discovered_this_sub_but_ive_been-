#post{{First time seeing this. But the story goes like this. Last year after my exams I had to resit a few that I failed. During this revision I still wasted so much time on #a-t-instagram{{instagram}}, #a-t-facebook{{facebook}} and #a-t-snapchat{{snapchat}} everyday it was stupid. After my exams were done I passed 2 but still had failed one for the second time so this year i’ve had to resit it. 1 year later and out of the 11 exams #ben-better-school{{I’ve had this year i’ve passed all not much problem}} (including the resit) #ben-feel-better{{Been a lot happier}} in general which has been pointed out by close friends. They ask if i’ll ever go back to it but my answers just been I don’t need to I don’t want to. On a deeper level everyone knows how superficial people can be because of social media and how toxic it can be. But then I self-assessment made me realise I’m #symp-wasted-time{{wasting my own time}} to be more superficial and look like i’m having more fun than I needed to. I do enjoy going out and chatting to people but it’s #ben-better-connection{{less meaningful when done through pics and DMs opposed to just having a laugh and rethinking it/rewatching it later}}. I kinda stopped caring as much what people were posting if I wasn’t close to them and I realised that nobody cares what anybody else is posting besides maybe celebrities and your crush.
I’d sum up instagram as a highlight real of the moments you chose to share and it shouldn’t really change how you view others or yourself - but that’s how it ends up being used.
Many thanks for reading :) Enjoy yourselves}}
