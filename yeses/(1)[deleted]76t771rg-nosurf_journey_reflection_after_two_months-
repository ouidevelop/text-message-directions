#post{{Hi NoSurf-ers: 

A quick reflection after two months of #nosurf. I've been successful in avoiding #a-t-tv-and-movies{{TV}}/#a-t-games{{chess}}/#a-t-porn{{NSFW content}} (with only a few minor relapses). Now these three activities feel quite dull, and are not addictive at all.

My life has not been easy; my job search ended successfully at an internship with one of my favourite companies. I've also had minor health issues, and problems dealing with stress. Nevertheless #ben-feel-better{{I'm much happier than before}}, #nosurf has given me the ability to #ben-focus-on-problems{{focus on my problems, and work towards solving them}}.

Wishing you all the best in your #nosurf journey :). It's definitely worth the effort.}}
