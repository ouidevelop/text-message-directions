#post{{**Short version**: I used the internet for entertainment for up to 16 hours a day for about 15 years. Then I quit in literally one day by reading #book-smart-phone-dumb-phone{{Smart Phone Dumb Phone}}, by Allen Carr &amp; John Dicey. It approaches addiction completely differently to any other method, and you can get it for free online.

This is the **only** method that has worked for me. I've lost track of how long it's been since I quit. 

If you feel like your internet use is out of control, or damaging, or just unwanted, then please read this book. I cannot overstate how powerful an effect it has had on me. I have no vested interest in the book beyond knowing how desperate I was to quit the internet, knowing that it worked, and knowing that other people are likewise suffering.

I found it for free online but am unsure about the rules with sharing links like that. Send me a DM if you have trouble finding it.

Below is a detailed explanation of my addiction, my experience with this method, and what life has been like afterwards. Ignore it if you don’t need convincing.

\--------------------------

I was addicted to the internet and gaming for at least 15 years, probably longer, and tried everything I could to quit. Blocking software, days off, complete cold-turkey, schedules and daily limits. I went to a psychologist. I bought a computer for writing and removed the network card. Nothing worked.

I was becoming resigned to being a person who spent 16 hours a day doing nothing but watching #a-t-youtube{{youtube videos}}, #a-t-forums{{reading forums}}, and #a-t-games{{playing games}}. I desperately wanted to be different but I always ended up back online.

Today, I don’t know how long it’s been since I’ve used the internet for entertainment. More importantly, though, I have no desire to use it as anything but a tool. I feel completely different. The internet is no longer a lure, I have no cravings to use it. There is no struggle. I truly believe that I have reclaimed my life.

I am not going to describe the book in depth, but know that if you read it with an open mind it is capable of reconfiguring the way you think about your online habits. I don’t know if this book hypnotises you or if it’s just so persuasive that you can’t help but agree, and I don’t care. It is as simple as this book having done for me what nothing else has been able to do.

You may be thinking that your internet addiction is too severe to be dismantled by a book. Mine was severe. I would wake up every morning and immediately read news and other things I actively disliked. Then I would get up, sit at my computer, and browse more internet while trying to summon the effort to work. Eventually I would capitulate to my addiction and play a game or watch youtube videos. On good days, I would pry myself away from it for five or ten minutes to do something productive. This might happen a few times. On bad days my consumption would continue unimpeded into the night. When I got too tired I would take my phone to bed and watch videos until I fell asleep.

#symp-misc{{I hated what I was doing}}. I watched videos for things I couldn’t care less about and even managed to pretend that I had developed an interest in them. The things #symp-not-doing-interests{{I wanted to be doing—reading, writing, studying languages, exercising—I never did.}}

#symp-lying-about-use{{I lied about my internet use to other people, and I would quickly switch tabs when my partner walked past.}} It made me deceptive and I didn’t like it. But despite all this, I could not stop doing it.

Since reading the book, in the space of a single day, I am a completely different person. #other-activities{{I wake up and spend an hour or two studying Catalan}}. #other-activities{{I work on my novel during the day}}. #other-activities{{If I need a break I read}} or #other-activities{{exercise}} or study Catalan again. #other-activities{{I go for walks}}, #other-activities{{I have started or completed tasks and ideas I’ve wanted to do for a long time}}. At night, #other-activities{{I cook}} and #other-activities{{listen to music}}, #other-activities{{watch Spanish TV}}, or read more. When I go to bed I take my e-reader and am often too tired to even read anything.

None of this is even difficult. It’s not a matter of willpower or of discipline. It’s simply that I want to be doing these things, and I don’t want to be online all the time. The book has shown me how to act in alignment with my actual desires and values.

I am not trying to brag about the things I am doing. As I mentioned, not long ago I was the opposite.

I honestly believe that if everyone who came to this sub read the book then the sub would not need to exist. Every single quit the internet technique—with the exception of the one outlined in this book—shares the same core assumptions about addiction that are incongruous with actually quitting.

Some people might be sceptical of the book’s claim to cure your addiction without the use of willpower. I was extremely dubious of this claim when I started reading the book, since conventional advice about quitting anything hinges on willpower and denial. The framework laid out in the book makes it clear that willpower is, despite our assumptions, not involved. Nor is denial. I was persuaded by its logic and still don’t feel that I exert willpower to eliminate harmful internet use.}}
