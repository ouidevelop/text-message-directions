#post{{ **What benefits did I accrue?**

#ben-more-time{{* **More time.** I feel the days pass by slower, I don't feel that my weekends are gone in an instant.}}
#ben-feel-better{{* **Improved sense of well-being.**}}
   #ben-less-comparing{{* I don't compare myself to anyone and feel affected by others achievements or failures}}
   #ben-more-positive{{* I feel more positive and upbeat.}} #ben-appreciate-more{{I enjoy small things like the weather (e.g. sunny or rainy day) or spending time with my family}}
   * I have replaced the time that I have spent on these apps with waking up every day (incl. weekends) at 6am, #other-activities-contemplative{{meditating}}, #other-activities-journal{{journaling}} etc.
#ben-productive{{* **More productive when working.** I don't feel as "cloudy" in my thoughts. They seem to come to me slightly quicker. Although, my deep work is still disturbed by my work chat &amp; work e-mail!}}

**What did I do?**

I have been off #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}}, #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}}, #a-t-snapchat{{Snapchat}}, #a-t-tv-and-movies{{Netflix}}, #a-t-twitter{{Twitter}} for the past 6-12 months. Also, #tech-delete{{uninstalled almost all news apps}} (very sensational and mentally disturbing). I did this in a phased manner.

Most recently, I uninstalled #a-t-linkedin{{LinkedIn}} (3 months ago) and Reddit (mobile app). **I still use WhatsApp and Signal.** #tech-stop-notifications{{On WhatsApp, I have muted 60-70% of chats}}, most of the messages you receive do not require a notification.

**How I did it?**

1. I understood that most things are not that urgent and **you are caught in a bad habit loop**: Receive notification &gt;&gt; Look at phone &gt;&gt; Dopamine release
2. I better understood that if something is free and you are using it for extended periods of time, **You are the revenue source.** Your time is being sold to advertisers
3. I believed that I am **creating a low-attention span mind.** The mind that I have is one. The same mind that is addicted to social media, is the one that I am using to work towards my dreams
4. #tech-ask-why-when-picking-up-phone{{Before doing any activity **I asked myself two questions (both online and offline)**:
   1. Why am I doing this? *&lt;often times I started using my phone involuntarily and out of reflex&gt;*
   2. Does this help me get closer towards my dreams *&lt;often times the answer was no}}&gt;*}}
