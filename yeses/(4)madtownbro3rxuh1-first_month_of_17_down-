#post{{I'm sitting in a cafe right now typing this out because I wanted to take time to make a point of congratulating myself, checking in here to let you all know how I'm doing with my lifestyle change, and talk about where I want to go with this, the kind of stuff that's happening related to this experience etc.

A great idea that someone recently gave to me: Make a daily list of the things that you did today that you're proud of.  I've been doing it every day or every few days for the last two or so weeks and I think it makes a real difference.  I'm the kind of person that's quick to find fault with myself, that instantly sees the things I've done wrong.  It's hard for me to acknowledge the importance of the things I'm doing right.

So this is related to that.  I need to take a moment to recognize where I'm at and see what's going right.

So no internet use, porn use, or electronics use at home with the exception of skyping family about once a week!  

That's been going on for a month now, and it's just great usually.  

My "experiment" is: going without electronics use at home (with exception of skyping family), #a-t-porn{{pornography}}, and added sugars in foods (donuts, cookies, french fries, etc.) for 17 full months, until Jan. 2017 to see what happens in my life, what changes.

A bit of background: Young male early 20s, 19 months sober from addiction to marijuana and alcohol abuse.  So just to be clear, I am already coming from a place where I do not alter myself with substances, a choice which I think is often vastly underestimated for what it's actually worth.  

I'm coming from a place where I'm generally unhappy with my life- feel shy, lacking in skill and the intuition that one generally finds in people that are highly skilled.  I often feel like I'm letting my time slide by without an appreciable amount of development/effect happening.  I often burnout from not setting clear/realistic work expectations, and as hinted at before, am generally unhappy with my social skills, situation, status.  I do not feel as if I've identified possible directions for what I may do.

I'm addicted to pornography and the internet and use them so that most of the time I'm abstaining from it, often gritting my teeth to get through a craving to use it, and then letting go once every month or two and sometimes going 2-3 days without doing anything but masturbating and surfing #a-t-youtube{{youtube}} and eating ice cream.

#symp-cravings{{The cravings are incredibly distracting}} and the general problem of having to try so hard to control my internet and porn use is so exhausting that it leaves room for little else.  I am a very mediocre student even though I often *feel* like I put in the hours (not to say it actually turns out that way- I generally don't know and can't be certain how my time has been spent over the last year or so) and all this stuff just eats at my self-esteem, and it gets to the point where I devalue myself and so others around me see me treating myself like this and treat me like this in turn.

I believe that my eating habits are generally healthy but would like to eliminate these binges and insatiable cravings for sweet foods, which I know do not bring me anything, and make me feel sluggish and tired after eating them.  Thus the food change.

What I think is happening is each time I do this stuff that makes me feel bad, I'm filling some kind of hole, some kind of scary unknown, where the easier option is to use something to alleviate having to feel like that.  Perhaps they're potential developmental plateaus.  I don't know.  Maybe just plain old boredom, and electronics cause such an intense reaction that I am unable to be bored while they're in my reach.

Now, as promised, positives :)

What I want for myself and why I'm doing this:

I want to feel good about myself during my life and I don't want to make the same mistakes over again.  I believe the average person is capable of an incredible amount of things, and I want to nurture a lot of interests and create things and be very good at as many things as I can.

I think that a lot of stuff is just around the corner for me, because life is just so big that this must be the case if change is happening.  So it's very exciting, if just I could reach it and attain the next levels and next plateaus.  And it's happening right now of course, provided I don't give up and don't fail my current opportunities and don't give up if I do.

So I'd like to be able to be the person who everyone likes and admires, because I'd like to be very useful, in fact, irreplaceable.  I'd like to know love and be with people that drive me crazy thinking about them.  I'd like to be an excellent student, someone who has a dizzying amount of options before him, someone who contributes to the process of education while undergoing it.  I'd like to make my family as proud of me as I am of them as I see them live and grow and do the things they do.

I'd like to have time to do sports, study school and things I want to learn about for my own purposes, and socialize in meaningful ways.

Ok now more concretely: developments during this last month/observations:

I've been using internet/computer at the library when I need to do school reports or check email or whatever.  Random internet searches have been extremely few and far in between and my email usage has dropped dramatically.  I unsubscribed from facebook a few months ago, and cannot recommend this highly enough: one of the things that really bothered me about GTA 5 was the pervading negative tone of the game, how people were presented.  Well Facebook gives me the same feeling, as well as the feeling that everyone else is an investment banker chilling in Saint Tropez with their hot girlfriends.  Just no thanks.

I had one period of about a day or two when I thought I was going to crack.  I didn't.  I realized that this was probably due to spending inordinate amounts of time rewatching videos my family had sent to me as well as just me feeling like shit because of a bad day or something, so I recognized the problem, stopped what I thought might be contributing to the problem, and it went away.

I dared to go into a social situation I would've considered suicide a month ago: I feel completely outclassed by these people and was sure I was going to be a burden on their conversation and fun time.  It was not so!

I've probably had maybe 5-10 days of burnout/inactivity this last month.

I've been reading a lot, but must be careful even with reading.  So I work most days all day (morning to late afternoon) on school-related stuff and then come home and have free time.  I'm more or less convinced that concrete working hours and well-spent free time are the antidote to burnout and this is how sustainable schedules are created.

But reading just because you're tired and want to plop down and have nothing else you feel like doing is kind of a waste of time and definitely doesn't leave me feeling renewed.  So I try to read exclusively at night time, trying to keep pretty solid bedtimes, because sleep is so, so important for how you feel and perform.

By the way for anyone interested: Scott Young, http://www.wtfprofessor.com/, have been super resources on learning, etc.

Anyway, got to go, caf√© is closing.  More on it later!

#title:{{Around 2 months in}} #permalink:/r/nosurf/comments/3x4icg/around_2_months_in/, #created:1450298826 

#post{{Hi all,

So I'm back visiting my folks right now and I guess around 70 days without porn and electronics. That's nice!  The last two months have been largely excellent and I'll talk a little bit about that, because I'm kind of down in the dumps right now and it'd do me good to reflect on what I have achieved as well as hopefully serve to show others out there that it's totally possible to live in large part without Internet/media or other forms of electronic entertainment.

First things first, I'm typing this out at home, which goes against my rules I set for myself.  Basically I felt out of my element, out of the swing of things, and so I decided over these last few days to use electronic media, although I haven't used it in a way that I'm not OK with, apart from the fact that I'm violating what I think are pretty good guidelines, and so I won't do that anymore.

I won't reset my badge though for the same reason I won't consider my food regime to be messed up simply because I wasn't careful one time- it's all about the long-haul.  I still want this thing and I want it badly and I'm trying very hard, but I wasn't careful and instead of beating myself up, I'm going to look forward and consider the marathon aspect of what I'm engaged in.

I mean carelessness comes in all degrees- over the last two months, I've surfed for swimming technique tips, and I call surfing anything that is unplanned, aimless searching, and one time I watched Olympic competitions for like 3 hours on end (all of this at the library- in harmony at least with the one basic wish I had for myself), so this is how I mess up still sometimes with regards to electronics.  

I've been getting better at keeping perspective and not letting relatively tiny failures phase me though, because I know by now how important it is that I do this work on myself, and how silly it would be to throw all the good stuff away, that being a hard fact, because relatively excellent things have been happening to me for the two months I've put in.

And I think it would be easier for a lot of people going through Internet addiction, porn addiction, or generally trying to change themselves if there were a greater sense of hope and cohesiveness, so I think that this kind of action is very important.

So let's see: #other-activities-exercise{{I've started swimming again}}.  I used to swim competitively when I was younger, and since about late October, I've been hitting the pool about 2-3 times per week and can go below 30 seconds for a 50m free, which I'm pretty happy about.  Plus I can swim much harder, take shorter rests, and my stroke seems to be getting better.  As a nice side benefit, I've been getting a little buff and it's kind of funny because my left lat muscle is bigger than my right lat because of me not doing enough bilateral breathing!  Anyway, swimming is a beautiful sport to watch and practice and feels AWESOME!!

So I never would've stuck with it while binge surfing at least once a week and watching porn to feed my porn addiction.

About that: I beat a major urge to watch porn around two weeks ago.  This is the first time I've come through an urge like that without succumbing and it's shown me it's possible.  So I was living my life, just chilling, and seemingly out of nowhere I started to have the porn fantasies in my head again.  But it felt under control, something like where you wait a couple hours and it goes away.  No, it built and over a period of a couple days.  It got to the point where I was convinced I was going to use, that it was just a question of when and how I would crack, because I couldn't think of anything else and it felt like using porn would be the best, most intense feeling I could possibly want; all this in the midst of days of lethargy and self-disappointment.  Anyone who's had an intense porn craving can identify.  Still I held on because somewhere in my mind that was the best solution still- hang on just a little more and find something to help.

So it eventually came to my attention that my internet box was downstairs in plain sight, doubtless from me talking to my parents using Skype.  My original idea was to keep electronics shut away upstairs in my attic because I think that seeing them constantly doesn't help your willpower resist the temptation.  I decided to shut them upstairs and wait.  And it got better!  The intense, unbearable craving immediately started to get more manageable and within a day or two it was gone!

This is really significant because I beat something that has historically really fucked me up.  I've never beaten a craving of that magnitude before and now I have a precedent.

#ben-better-school{{I have gotten very positive feedback for my school efforts as of these last two months}}.  I don't know if I talked about this last time I posted here, but I had made an outcast of myself the school year before this one, because of my spotty attendance and the fact that my grades were at the bottom of my class.  That has been obviously a very painful experience and one I didn't think I would recover from.

I now do think I will recover from it.  It's strange, finding yourself knowing the answers for things, without being especially aware of the preparatory efforts that must have been made to get there, but the sweet end result is the same- #ben-more-self-esteem{{positive social feedback and positive self-esteem}}.  More precedents.  I think I'll do from just fine (if I go through the study motions in a lacklustre manner, as I've been approaching it for these last few weeks) or excellent if I can figure something out and put a brain in my head.

But nonetheless, perhaps i undervalue the transition from poor student to average student, which must take place before I can move into the region I desire for myself.  No more shitting myself for labs and relying on everyone else but myself to know how to do stuff.  No more twiddling my thumbs during exercise sessions because I don't even know where to start.  No more "I'll learn how to do that later".  People ask how you're doing because they see you coming regularly and you've even shared a joke with them once or twice.  

#ben-feel-better{{Overall, it's felt very good}}, and i can say that it feels a whole lot better than jerking off over and over again to stuff that you hate and rush to turn off as soon as it's over or #symp-worse-sleep{{staying up until 4 in the morning watching}} Breaking Bad on #a-t-tv-and-movies{{Netflix}}, eating a whole thing of ice cream and waking up at 1 the next day.

#ben-more-self-esteem{{There's a lot more self-respect in living without treating myself like this}}, and I think consequently a lot more fun and rewarding experiences to be had, as these new doors open up and broaden.

Because there are a lot of things I want to do (some of which I have started doing!!) that I just don't think are possible if I don't set the conditions up to be right for myself: treating myself well, exercising and trying to eat well, treating others well and having honest relationships with people.  

So some of the things I want to work on: stepping up my academic game a lot.  Reading with more and more intent- looking up words when I don't understand what they mean for example.  Getting interested in Latin.  Setting athletic goals. Figuring out who I want to be more with people- thinking about things from their point of view more and being more courageous when interacting with people- not introducing useless conversation.  Respecting my time more and recording it- keeping track of how my days go and what seems to best work for me.  Generally listening to myself a lot better.  Ultimately that's how I think I'll get out on the other side of this thing.

It's kind of hazy- but I know what I need to do.  I need to focus on exams right now and put whatever in place that needs to be there so that I can be as proud of myself as possible when they're over so as to get the sweetest precedent of them all, so far.  I've seen peoples' character demeanor change from exams- someone telling you that you're distinguished makes it so!

#title:{{Day 0 + Success story of almost 3 months without!}} #permalink:/r/nosurf/comments/43jg77/day_0_success_story_of_almost_3_months_without/, #created:1454254265 

#post{{**My life then:**

#ben-better-school{{I went from being the worst student in the class to one of the best, in two months.}}  I was a swimmer in high school and I started swimming again, a couple times per week plus doing dryland (core strength) exercises; I was able to compete against my little brother in an alumni vs. current team meet and I was approaching my old high school times.  #other-activities-read{{I started reading intensively and usefully}}- I got in the habit of keeping a notebook in which I‚Äôd write down words I didn‚Äôt know and ideas that struck me in my reading and I digested them and tried to synthesize my own voice out of that.  I started eating healthily.  No more added sugar, no more meats, no more junk food, no more treating myself badly as an acceptable way of life.  I felt great and strong.  #ben-better-sleep{{I went to bed on time most nights and if I didn‚Äôt, I didn‚Äôt stay up ridiculously late and it was invariably spent in reading.}}  When I burned out from working too much/poorly when I wasn‚Äôt careful, I‚Äôd waste the afternoon in reading.  And the burnouts weren‚Äôt accompanied by a sense of hopelessness, but more a sense of ‚ÄúI guess I gotta relax right now and then can get back to it‚Äù, not really any real despair, and it was soon, because after all, how long can you sit and stare into space?

The most striking feature was probably how my academic situation seemed to turn around by itself.  I was somehow doing the exercises and assignments before class and thus coming prepared.  The way I experienced labs transformed from abject horror- having no idea what I‚Äôm doing, running around trying to scavenge from other students, to me being autonomous and perceiving them as a series of fun challenges to be met.  Literally during the exams, it felt as if someone else were using my hand to write the correct answers, answers I knew to be correct, and as if someone else were using my mouth to explain the ideas to the professors, and that person was me.  It actually was a very surreal feeling- feeling like I don‚Äôt know much, but somehow able to respond to all of the prompts required of me.  So I got very good grades and I‚Äôm on track to attain the vision I had for myself in the beginning of the year, yet at that moment was afraid to set concretely, because I had no methodology: to get the second most prestigious academic distinction awarded by the university (next year it‚Äôll be the most prestigious one I can only hope!).

I like attaining new levels and I like feeling periodically ecstatic when confronted by the harvested fruits and better yet and much more importantly, improved overall ‚Äúground states‚Äù if you will.    My lifestyle adjustments are all about that.

**My life now:**

I had started my last streak on Oct. 6 and broke it during a visit to family during Christmas week.  The atmosphere was cozy and chillax; usage of media was ubiquitous.  Gradually my defenses came down.  I stopped being cautious about being near the blaring TV and one day rationalized a game of Crash Bandicoot with a sibling as a bonding activity.  Well soon came Netflix and then porn and before I knew it, I was up until 2-3 in the morning #a-t-games{{playing GTA 5}} during the time off I had from school to study for my exams.

Even though I wasted so much time during the time school gave us off to study- I still studied- enough, and most importantly had a lot of momentum carried through from during the semester.  I still had planned my studying poorly so I found that for most classes, there were usually at least a chapter and sometimes half of the class to cram in a couple of days or hours.  Not ideal.

So now I‚Äôve finished exams, did very well, and how do I reward myself?  A half-week long binge on internet and porn that started with feeling lonely and like I didn‚Äôt know how to take a break, because I kept trying to do other intellectual activities that I guess were burning me out.  So I felt a hole and figured since I‚Äôd been lapsing a bit since Christmas, might as well.  Other people went skiing and shit like that, and that‚Äôs what I want to do too, stuff like that, but the continuity is lacking when I‚Äôm like this, I didn‚Äôt have the confidence or even the idea that I might like to actually take a break, or what that means.  I‚Äôm not meaning to chastise myself; I‚Äôm frustrated and afraid because I‚Äôm treating myself this way.

So how I feel right now: #symp-fear{{afraid because I‚Äôm in the internet trap right now}}.  I have the fear of rationalizing myself into using it again tomorrow, of not even being able to make it out into the open.  How I feel when I‚Äôm using and why using internet like this and using porn sucks: because I‚Äôve only been going swimming like once a week now, and that has really been put on the back-burner, and I have pretty hard goals for myself that I want to reach by the end of the year for swimming.  Boom.  Month wasted in that arena.  Because I have a piano lesson tomorrow and nothing to show for it.  Piano lesson wasted, again, considering I actually forgot about the one two weeks ago during a porn binge; and while learning how to study well and keep up in school, I deprioritized piano so I‚Äôm afraid that it‚Äôs falling away, something I used to love so much.  Because stuff is going on the world and I‚Äôve spent a month of my life not working toward it (in any other way than studying for school); so many cool things to experience and me not using my short life time to experience it; the feeling of terror of depending upon fleeting motivation and illusions.  Because of the feeling of having jacked off for the fourth time in four hours and how much that hurts and how the orgasm is empty and boring before it‚Äôs even finished.  During the binge, the need to break out of it to do stuff like buy groceries and cook dinner, #symp-unreality{{and the distance you feel from reality}}, the feeling like you just jumped into a cold pool.  You get the idea.

If anything, I was talking about a ‚Äúground state of being‚Äù before, and being trapped in wasting your life on stupid shit online or in whatever other vehicle takes your ground state and wrecks it.  Perhaps this is its worst effect.  I mean I didn't even know any of this stuff existed or was possible for me, on this day, a year ago.


I‚Äôm going to get the cold pool effect when I‚Äôm done writing this (I‚Äôve spent a long time at this, editing and whatnot), but at least I‚Äôll have the hope of being done with this nonsense to bolster me for the time to come.  Nothing worse than the cold pool effect without any reasonable hope to buffer it. 

**Food: this was an important part of my lifestyle change and mentality shift.**

I was also eating healthily during this entire period up until now, except for Christmas week, and it wasn‚Äôt very hard to come back from that, as soon as I‚Äôd left my parents‚Äô house.  So I never eat stuff with added sugar if I'm aware of it, I eat a lot more fruits and vegetables, and I don't eat meat anymore, except for maybe the rarest occasions, but that hasn't really come up yet.  For some reason, the food thing has been a lot easier to maintain than the electronics.  I haven‚Äôt really ever seriously wanted to go out and buy ice cream to accompany a binge, which was something of a tradition of mine before.  I almost never feel cravings for sugars etc. and when I do, they go away really quickly.  What I eat: oatmeal for breakfast with sliced apples and raisins and OJ, rudimentary caprese sandwiches throughout the day + pears, pasta for dinner with some kind of good-tasting grain such as quinoa or amaranth or lentils mixed in with the sauce.  I only drink water and once a day or so, juice and or tea.  For others: get in the habit of carrying around a water bottle!!  These are my staples, and I envision being able to survive at least for a year while looking for a bit more nutritive variety and stuff to avoid things like vitamin B12 deficiency and so on, while not getting too stressed about it.

**Lessons/ideas:**

-	I got through at least one major urge to watch porn during those two and change months by knowing that I had a swim meet I was looking forward to that I did not want to give up on.  I did not want to be around all those people I knew and waste all the excitement and energy that went into preparing for it on my part feeling like I couldn‚Äôt look people in the eye.  I didn‚Äôt want to be swimming against my little bro and not be able to give it my best because I had stayed up until 2 watching Netflix and porn.  It seems to me then that I should ‚Äúbook‚Äù events, events requiring my participation for the near future and as far as I can to help sustain the focus.  Events I get excited about and deeply care about. 

-	Fuck Netflix, fuck porn, fuck video games, fuck the internet, fuck social media, fuck all the people and institutions that tell you you can‚Äôt do what you want to do, fuck online dating and people shopping.  Fuck fucking fuck it all.  I‚Äôm not one to swear usually, and I‚Äôm angry in this moment, that so many people are held down by what amounts to just stupid shit.  I‚Äôm angry that I feel constantly torn between wanting to live my life the way I want to live it, and realizing that I believe that that means MINIMAL if any engagement with electronic devices that I don‚Äôt want (a stereo system would fit very nicely in my home for example!), and on the other hand feeling like I can‚Äôt because I live in a ‚Äúconnected world‚Äù and ‚Äúwe need to be connected‚Äù and it‚Äôs important for career success, etc.  OK, so here‚Äôs how I‚Äôve come to see it: Yes, absolutely, the internet and perhaps most electronic devices even offer things that are arguably indispensible: instant information source/means of communication above all.  Right, so I‚Äôd be missing out on essential needs in fact (relative to other people!) if I completely eschew the internet and the iStuff.  I however view it not as irreplaceable, but more as something I need to acknowledge and come up with extremely creative solutions for.  Extremely creative, because as far as I‚Äôm aware, no one has thought of this and no one really cares, because all they have to do is connect.  So I feel that it‚Äôs quite unfair that I‚Äôve been put into this situation, because I don‚Äôt know if I will make it out.  I think the internet is so dangerous, because you can go your entire life without finding out who you are or where you are; it‚Äôs just possibly another disaster to be avoided if anything, like drugs. 

-	This or something akin to this is what I need for myself.  My life has responded so positively to this short and all too brief experience that I‚Äôm convinced that this is what I need to do to be able to access what I want for myself.  My Mom‚Äôs opinion of all of this is that it‚Äôs not the electronics itself, but rather that I‚Äôm using it as a vehicle for cultivating self-discipline and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm seeing such benefits.

-	In Alcoholics Anonymous, more veteran members often recommend ‚Äú90 meetings in 90 days‚Äù to newcomers.  This is largely so that they can increase their chances of surviving a crucial part of early sobriety by subsisting on a daze of AA meetings and coffees with members etc, and so that they can become attached to the group.  I did something akin to that after I talked to a member who advised me to throw out the marijuana seeds I was hanging onto, into the street; and I must‚Äôve realized at that point that the fact that I found it so difficult to let go of the vestiges of my drug addiction signified that I had better take my sobriety damn seriously.  So I did the 90 meetings in 90 days (not the precise number).  My point is (to myself) **throw out the half-measures, now, and get seriously involved in some kind of process.**  

-	I love music.  If I‚Äôm not going to listen to my iPod or even use YouTube at the library, I must respect my needs and be serious about going to concerts.  I‚Äôve missed the opportunity to see my favorite artist perform because I waited too long to book tickets and she‚Äôs way more popular than I thought so I can‚Äôt even go to other cities to see her.  How do I discover new music when I don‚Äôt have the internet to use?  These are all things I don‚Äôt know how to do yet.  The lack of music in my life really concerns me when it comes to my piano.  Before I had this internal drive to play piano as I heard it played, and I seemed to hear so many beautiful things I wanted to do.  I always found my music through what I had listened to.  I don‚Äôt have this drive anymore, piano and music even seem to no longer be a must, and practice seems mechanical and the music boring.  I can only attribute this to my lack of musical input.
   
-	I need to learn how to play.  What is playing?  Is it hanging out with friends, or doing specific activities with them?  Is it making an effort to do ridiculous, funny things like sing impossible songs in a falsetto?  Is it setting aside time to go to art museums?  It's strange because I saw so many people at the art museum that did not look comfortable or like they were "playing" at least.  How should I instead feed the needs that arise that make me feel like I want to escape into the internet, when that happens?  I think a good idea might be to regularly brainstorm ideas I have as to play; for example just now I had the idea of getting some artistic felt tip markers and drawing some weird motifs in my ‚Äúintellectual‚Äù notebook and seeing what that did for me.   

-	I‚Äôve been trying to do this alone for around a year now and while I get time away from electronics here and there, it seems to be missing something.  I talked about unaddressed needs as being a real problem, and I‚Äôm wondering whether I do in fact need a kind of support system to be able to get what I want out of this.  I only have one friend in real life with whom I talk regularly and in depth about this issue, and while he admits he doesn‚Äôt like the porn and the way he games either, he isn‚Äôt willing to pursue it any farther.  If I structured it well, my family could help me with this- as of yet, they‚Äôre still uninvolved except the occasional inquiry as to how it‚Äôs going with the electronics.  This group is a brilliant idea, but ultimately still on the internet and I believe that the internet produces some kind of physiological reaction within me.  I bet I need to try meeting people more and more, through events especially.  I need to be extra resourceful when it comes to finding these events; I think I deeply believe that the people I‚Äôd really jibe with and really want in my life are somehow ‚Äúhidden‚Äù.

**Plan:**  I think that I must produce a written plan, and then edit it continually for this attempt at change to be effectual.  Btw, one of the delusions I consistently have to fight is the ‚Äúyou‚Äôd be so much more creative if you were writing on the computer.‚Äù  Uh-huh, right.  So I don‚Äôt have a plan other than the idea that I want to go 100 days without any electronics use that isn‚Äôt strictly necessary + still being able to communicate with family of course (I do this in the privacy of my home of course).  Partly because I‚Äôve been trying to come up with such a ‚Äúcanonical‚Äù plan over these last couple days and ending up doing nothing but watching porn and youtube.  So ASAP- just start and make the commitment to work on it steadily over time and watch how it unfurls.  It really could be just that simple.  

I think at this point that I‚Äôm going to go 100 days, I‚Äôm going to solidify it and go 100 days without anything but the strictly necessary electronics use (in public spaces only) and then come back on here and write how that was.  My goal is a year‚Äôs time without using electronics at home and not using it recreationally to see what it does for me.

So wish me luck!  I‚Äôll be back in 100 days then, I guess.  Last time I wasn‚Äôt even trying to eliminate all use in public- I‚Äôd often surf stuff for swimming or whatnot in the library and it didn't seem to interfere with anything, but I wonder if it really is just better without.

#title:{{38 days into (at least) 7 month NoSurf journey}} #permalink:/r/nosurf/comments/5hqf6h/38_days_into_at_least_7_month_nosurf_journey/, #created:1481468584 

#post{{Hey, I just wanted to drop a line and check in with the NoSurf community.  I've been very happy with the last 38 days, and have been making enormous progress towards my dreams- which are still quite vague and abstract, but the major chunks are there, so I can and do spend most of my days taking action towards them.  I make mistakes and waste time, but if you think about it, this is a pretty optimized path - either this, or just vaguely feeling like I want to be able to do these things in life, without ever being able to bring myself to act on it (out of lack of interest and suffocating doubt; these symptoms really do alleviate when you live in your own world - not that of others) 

I had hoped to go to a cafe and write down exactly what's going through my mind and what I'm experiencing, but I just don't have the energy to do so apparently - perhaps the old internet mirage: "Just go check out these few things and everything will be alright" :)

Something that is pretty clear to me today - I feel best when my computer usage is strategically minimized - that is I am using the true minimum I am capable of using.  Life becomes alive.  So I have some obligations that require computer usage, and I feel like last week, I've perhaps become sloppy and started using the internet more than I've had to, and not been strategic about batching sessions.  

So far, the 38 days have been totally great.  My bottom line is no internet at home and above all, no porn.  

7 months because I need to give myself a real shot, I realize, otherwise I risk missing what life has to offer and what I can do in life, and just stay this muted person.  Also, because I hope to be able to decouple negative internet use (#symp-less-self-controll{{porn, recreational bullshit that erodes feelings of self-control}}) from positive use (positive media and using the computer as a tools).  And 7 months was how many day boxes fit onto the page that's now taped on my wall :)

I'll keep you posted as to how things evolve :) 

I highly recommend an extended time away from things that you suspect mute your potential.}}
