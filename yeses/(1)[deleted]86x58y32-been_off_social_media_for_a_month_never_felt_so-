#post{{The three most important things I've done this year:

* Get diagnosed with ADHD
* Get as healthy as possible
* #tech-delete{{Delete all social media}}

&amp;#x200B;

**Story**

I failed high school, a university preparation course, dropped out of university multiple times, and struggled at employment due to undiagnosed ADHD. During all of this, #symp-wasted-time{{I also spent excessive amounts of time online}}. The internet was exciting when I was young, but gradually got more hostile while I was unable to log off. #symp-getting-into-trouble{{I was posting inflammatory content under my name, caused dramas, getting emotionally provoked by the algorithm, and getting into the most jaw-dropping dramas}}. I knew it was bad for me, but because I had undiagnosed ADHD I couldn't stop.

The people, drama, and content I saw online got more extreme each year. In the past few years, I saw some messed up scenarios I'd have never come across in real life.

#tech-adhd-diagnosis{{After an ADHD diagnosis at 25}}, I've lost heaps of weight, got employed, managed to wean off all social media, get a flip phone, and generally living a happier life.

**Thoughts on social media**

Almost everyone I know seems to realise social media is bad for them, but has a reason to stay on.

After a month off social media, it is obviously a good decision. Social media makes you more depressed, anxious, hostile, stupid, radical, lower social skills, and even an association to alcohol abuse. Because of how much impact social media has on people's well-being, you will be able to find a link to excessive social media use and almost any negative outcome. If research hasn't made a link yet, they will find a link in the future.

I bet eventually you will be able to see a link between lower life expectancy and excessive social media use. I also bet when our generation are elderly and surveyed on regrets, spending so much time on screens will be our generation's top regret.

Every reason people stay on social media is overrated and also improves when you sign off.

When you aren't on social media, it makes you more rare and people value your presence more. Your relationships with your friends become valuable when you are less accessible. People make an effort to invite you to things.

If someone wants to connect with you but realises you aren't on social media, they'll make an effort to get your details.

When you aren't able to spend all day chatting on the internet, you naturally start finding ways to connect with people in person. You start finding new ways to fill the time.

You feel better, do better socially, and live a better life. The benefits of abandoning social media massively outweigh the cons.

While 26 is still young, I look at my history with regret. I look at my teenage years, early adulthood, and think of all the time I spent online. Those years aren't coming back. On top of that, #symp-bad-online-presence{{we live in a cancel culture now and all my youthful dumbassery is up there for display.}} I wish I spent time with my chums, not spending my youth in front of a screen and getting into insane drama online.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Ditching social media is an overwhelmingly good decision. Your reasons to stay are overrated and will improve too. Do it.}}
