#post{{# NEWS FLASH! REDDITOR DISCOVERS HIMSELF, BY DISCONNECTING FROM OTHERS!

   Please excuse the wonky title and random pace of my impromptu write up of my experience. I am riding an endorphin high and want to make this an interesting read for all of those who decide to hear the story. So hopefully I do not disappoint or bore you too much.

   When I began my nosurf journey. I thought you know what. As soon as I hit that delete button on #a-t-facebook{{facebook}}, the skies will open up. I will be blessed with the lights from the divine being that I choose to argue that doesn’t exist, even though time and time again weird hints are dropped to say “I am here numbskull. Look, see your watch, it stopped as soon as that church bell rang. Now watch, the service is over, the bell rang again magic, the watch is running again” but that’s a story for another time.

   So what happened when I deleted facebook? Well, the exact opposite. #withdrawal-difficult-thoughts-and-feelings{{The dark clouds above me got darker. Now, not only am I lost without cause, direction and an intoxicating dopamine high. I am alone with my thoughts, without some random person to vent to}} that I haven’t physically seen in 5 years but still talk to from time to time and probably would skittishly duck behind a bush to avoid any real interaction with.

   I will admit, it was rough. #withdrawal-time{{I spent a month}}, feeling like I just grounded myself. Why am I doing this? What did I do to myself to deserve this punishment. All that yummy delicious anxiety causing dopamine was ripped from my brain, my thumbs didn’t know what to do with themselves without being able to just scroll and scroll and scroll until the battery hit 4% and it was time to find that obnoxiously short phone cord that made me lay with my neck cricked to one side while painfully contorting my arms and body to make sure it didn’t come unplugged. Just to do it again, this time uncomfortably.

   Surely I can find a hobby to entertain my time. Everyone here says read a book and start drawing or something. On paper that sounded great! In practice, not so much. So you are telling me, the greatest thing to replace staring at a screen, is now staring at a piece of paper? But would that really, recharge my batteries? Would that be the magic answer to opening up the sky and having the big guy bless me with eternal dopamine, success and cure what is eternally wrong with the world? Probably not.

   So what did I do? Well, I decided to figure out what’s misaligned in my life to make me so desire the endless scroll. I took lots of mental health days in the form of vacation time. #other-activities-contemplative{{I meditated}}, #other-activities-walk{{went for walks.}} #ben-face-difficulties{{I replayed every scenario in my mind that once got me down. Came to terms with them, came to peace with them and moved on.}} One piece at a time. Then, I started setting my own goals, my own dreams and asked, what do I need to do with achieving them. What do I need to fix about me, to make me happy and the world around me a better place.

  I get it, you got this far and you are like, if this guy says “me“ or “I” one more time, I’m going to make a drinking game out of it with my friends and see who passes out first. Please don’t do this, someone will end up with liver damage or bringing home that clingy ex that you swore you would never talk to again and regret it. (Guilty)

   See, no surf shouldn’t be about scorched earth tactics without a plan. We all got here because of one reason or another. We are all tired of it for our own reasons. It’s like giving up drinking cold turkey after being an alcoholic for 10 years. Sure, some people one day just set the bottle down and never pick it up again. These people should be classified as super hero’s because… how? 

  What I discovered, is no surf needs to be a tool. Not a solution. Life, is about finding tools to solve problems. Carpenters can’t build a house with just a hammer. He needs saws, drills, ladders, wrenches, pliers, bandaids and a working knowledge of how a house is built. Your life, is your house. No surf wont build that house without tools and an understanding how to use these tools. Does the carpenter use the hammer for every part of the job? No. he would be a terrible carpenter if he tries to hammer an breaker into a junction box and probably would burn the whole house down in the process. Just like the hammer, no surf needs to be a tool that you know how to use at the right time and properly. Our society no longer functions without being glued to a screen at some point in time.

   So what about my self discovery process? Well here’s a few things I’ve come to terms with. I’ve been in denial about my ADD/ADHD diagnosis for 20 years. For the first time in my life, I’ve talked to my partner about it. Instead of getting frustrated and mad, because even though she should know why i act the way I do. I came clean, I explained it, I told her what to expect and how we can grow together with it, instead of inspire of it. An even bigger step, I have turned to get professional help to better understand and control it. I think 20 years of denying it and working around it, failing time and time again is enough proof, I cannot do it alone.

   I took a Briggs-meyers test to better understand my personality. So again, I can work with it, not against it. I cannot change who I am. I am who I am, but with this knowledge, I can change what I do and how to do it, to better work with what I got moving forward. Hint, I am an INTP, which means, I am a recluse by nature. My mind functions in a way that most of the world doesn’t understand. Im not a fan of leading, but i am also not a fan of being what to do. Paired with ADHD and I’m a walking universe of conversations in itself, I analyze everything, I over things everything, my favorite response is “I don’t know, maybe” or “it depends” a hundred different variables go into one decision. I hyper focus on tasks and my working memory has enough ram for about 15 minutes of engagement. Awkward, quirky, always busy, usually quiet unless I hit a spontaneous bump of excitedness then i will talk your ear off about the most randomest out of this world idea. Then the idea is gone.

   Life, is about self discovery. if you are not happy, discover yourself, your strengths, interest, goals and work for them. I still have no clue what I want to do with my life, I still have no clue what my plans are. But you know what? I am at peace right now. In the past few days, my confidence, my glow, my everything has radiated outwards on my family. Broken things in my life are getting fixed. #ben-made-friends{{I have made new friends at work, got to know new coworkers}}, had conversations I would have never had before. #ben-more-confident{{There is a confidence about me that hasn’t been there before}}. People approach me now that the body language has changed.

   Don’t let the fact that you have no direction hold you back from being you. It will come eventually. Do you think the dirt knew it was going to become the foundation for a house the next day? Probably not, its dirt. Do you think the foundation knew it was going to become a beautiful house someday? Probably not either. But eventually, it got there. It all came together. Because somebody had the right tools and took the time to assemble the pieces.

  Go find your tools, figure out how to use them in a way that works for you. If your hammer is different than someone else’s hammer, own that, its your pink rainbow glitter hammer. If your wrench  set is only in fractional metric sizes and somehow is still missing the 10.25mm, own that. We will never have the same perfect tools as someone else around us. our houses will never look like the guy across the street, and even if that code enforcer says it has to be built a certain way. What the hell does he know, he isn’t living in it. But make sure you build it in a way that its safe and wont come crashing down.}}

#post{{In attempt to work on being more personable and building actual relationships and friendships with people outside of social media. I ditched social media. I really truly wanted to recharge my social batteries and reconnect with people outside of the digital realm.

What I discovered? People are fake as fuck IRL as they are online. It doesn’t matter how close of a friend or how much trust you put into someone doing the right thing. You strike up a conversation, people are way more likely to “share” or “forward” what you said without you ever knowing. It seems even more likely that your life is displayed on a platter behind your back IRL over online anyways. Post something on Facebook, people will 90% of the time like it, scroll past it and forget about it.  Say something to a coworker or a friend and suddenly you are the topic of their conversation in the break room, their dinner table at home. Shits spreads like wildfire.

I went the nosurf route because I was sad, depressed felt like I wasn’t living up to social standards and norms. Felt like I needed to connect with people more. Fuck that, fuck them. There’s a reason bosses are shitty and billionaires are sadists. The climb to the top is full of naysayers, fakes, backstabbers, people who will try to purposely stunt and ruin you professionally just because you put in the effort to get ahead while they sat there and bitched about how shitty their boss is. Fuck em all.}}




#title:{{9 months post deleting social media (other than Reddit)}} #permalink:/r/nosurf/comments/xabj3d/9_months_post_deleting_social_media_other_than/, #created:1662770859 

#post{{I wanted to point out some pros and cons that I’ve encountered along the way. Some thoughts for the scorched earth route of going nomad.

For the longest time, like many of you. I had encountered the infamous doom scroll phase of life on Facebook. My mental health was in shambles, my physical health fell off a cliff, gaining 90lbs during the pandemic. Depression ruled the day, anxiety controlled the night. 

After deleting social media to avoid the pandemic nightmare, political abyss of red vs blue, #symp-comparing{{comparing myself to others}}, it took 3 months to finally settle my mind into self improvement. I’m an introvert, deleting everything made me a hermit.

Happy and relieved for all of 3 days, the #ben-self-improvement{{self healing and self improvement phase started}}. #ben-lost-weight{{I’m officially down 40lbs}}. Still have plenty of weight to drop, but I had nearly perfect bloodwork done, #ben-better-physical-health{{no longer prediabetic, cholesterol is finally a healthy range etc}}. I’ve been getting help for my ADHD and took a huge step in life. I finally went and seen a therapist to start getting professional help instead of doing it all on my own and failing time and time again.

Eventually, I see myself rejoining Facebook once I get to my goal weight and make more progress on therapy. But this time, for a different reason.

My therapist said something that really struck me as an “ah ha, I’m a damn fool moment” and it’s pretty common knowledge to most, but rarely followed by people like me and like us. 

You are who your friends are, you are the center of the circle of people you keep around you. 

Common sense right? Well, being a hermit now, who is my circle? Me. Which voices do I listen to? Well my own because that’s all I have. Well my own and all the voices of the people from the past who told me I can’t, that I am a failure, who shut me down. I was terrible at making friends and connections. So I latched on to those who came to me.

Who makes friends with 1 sided introverts? Extroverts who ran out of people to spread their negativity to because normal people already have this figured out. Keeping negative people around makes themselves more negative and interferes with who they are and what their goals are.

Life, is all about connections, who you know, how you can help each other elevate one another.

All or nothing and scorched earth tactics are fine for a while. Deleting everything is okay. But if you don’t take the time to do self improvement and self discovery in that time that you once spent dooms scrolling. You will be just as lost before, just with less company.

So yes, eventually I will reintroduce social media. When I am ready. When I have fully committed to understanding and creating an appropriate relationship with it. When I can fully use it as a tool, not as an entertainment piece. When I am emotionally and mentally mature enough to be able to pick and choose my circle of influence and connections.

Nobody climbs to the top alone. There is always some sort of mutual entity that helps elevate you to the next level. For me, it’s just a matter of self discovery to decide where exactly I want to go.

Still no goals written down, still no plan or roadmap in place. So I am not ready. 

My therapist asked me “what is happiness” I told her “success, a good home, well paying career, the American dream” she asked me, “what career goals do you have to get there, what job do you see yourself happy doing to make it a reality” I told her “I don’t know” then she gave me the look. That was the end of the session. But that look made all the difference.}}
