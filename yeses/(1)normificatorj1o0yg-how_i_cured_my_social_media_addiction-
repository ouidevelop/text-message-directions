#post{{It’s been a few years since I’ve made these changes and #ben-feel-better{{I feel great}}. Granted, sometimes I do lapse but only because I stray away from my guidelines. I’ll share them today and hopefully someone here will find it useful.

1. #tech-unsubscribe{{Unfollowed everyone on #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}} and #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}}.}}

I’m a competitive person. When I see someone doing better than me, it challenges me to better myself. #symp-comparing{{But when I see only the best sides of everyone while looking at my own slow progress, I feel depressed.}} The funny thing is I KNOW it’s an unrealistic portrayal yet my emotive mind doesn’t. This taught me that my perceptions are not always in my control and I need to control my sensory input to shape my perceptions. Unfollowing everyone helped tremendously.

2. #tech-stop-notifications{{Turned off all sound and vibration notifications.}}

These non visual notifications draw you towards your phone when you’re otherwise engaged in something else. Turn them off. 

3. #tech-do-other-things{{Start doing activities that make it impossible to check your phone. }}

Swimming, running, windsurfing, canoeing, anything that makes it dangerous to your phone. Set a time goal eg I will run for 20mins or I will canoe for 3hrs. 

4. #tech-plan-time{{Start structuring your life}}

Time tables! I’m a big fan of structure. I find that when I sit down and plan my day which repeats on a weekly basis, I make full use of my time. Fit the above mentioned activities on a regular basis into the timetable. It won’t feel all right at first and will need tweaking. I’ve had mine for 6 years now and I’m still tweaking it all the time but it’s much better. Now my time adapts to me as an individual instead of me adapting to the environment around me. 

5. #tech-time-limits{{Keep fixed sleeping hours with no visual phone usage at least 2 hours before bedtime.}}

The guideline says 30 mins but it doesn’t work for me. 2 hours hiatus is where it’s at for me. Might be different for you idk. Trick is to be disciplined in keeping this rule. Which helps if you..

6. #tech-misc{{Don’t totally cut out your phone life}}

Social media is here to stay. If you cut it out totally, you will rebound and use it with a vengeance when your discipline breaks. I use it while I commute surfing interest pages or catching up on news on reddit. This amount of usage works for me. You might have different goals, maybe you want to be fully off the grid. That’s fine too but going too hard too early will inevitably fail and demoralise you. Fight and win the small battles! 

Hope this helps!}}
