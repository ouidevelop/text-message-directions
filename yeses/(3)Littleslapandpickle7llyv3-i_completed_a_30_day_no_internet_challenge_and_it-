#post{{A little over 30 days ago I was addicted to "networked" sites, #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}} being the primary site of choice.

There was ALWAYS something novel and interesting.  The comments are freaking hilarious.  And it has #a-t-porn{{porn}}.  I mean, what more could you want!

I would open the app in bed upon waking up.  This was great because after 8 hours of sleeping my dashboard would have all new links to be explored.  It was like coming home to dozens of Amazon boxes on your doorstep just waiting to be opened. 

But I found myself increasingly unable to spend time away from "networked" sites such as Reddit, #a-t-pinterest{{Pinterest}}, #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}}, #a-t-tumblr{{Tumblr}}, ect.

Compared to the CONSTANT stimulation of these sites #symp-bored{{real life just seemed so bland.  Like a stew without any salt.}}

#tech-rules{{Basically I didn't allow myself on any time wasting website}}.  Absolutely no Reddit.  No Youtube.  No video sites whatsoever.  No website that suggests content according to the current content your looking at such as YouTube, Pinterest, Tumblr.  No social media whatsoever.  No porn.

As you can imagine this shrunk the internet quite a bit.

#tech-rules{{Another rule was absolutely no internet after 5 o'clock p.m.}} as I wanted to see what life was like without the option of diving into a screen whenever my mind got bored or uncomfortable.

I'm not gonna lie.  It was HARD.  And I was bored a lot.  I mean a lot.  But I did it.  I didn't lapse once. 

There are dozens of take-away's from this challenge, but I'll focus on only one for brevity.  

My brain physically changed.  Once coming back online I found these websites just weren't as interesting as before.  They didn't have the same hold on me, the spell seems to be broken.  I'll be on YouTube and think, "eh, this is boring" and I'll shut my computer and move on with my day.

Now, there is a lot of neurochemistry going on here, but if I got into that subject (which I love) this post would turn into 3000 words real quick.  

#ben-less-anxiety{{I also learned that life without the internet is much more calm}}.  The internet is literally buzzing with activity 24/7.  And it's activity is only growing exponentially.

#symp-anxiety{{But us humans didn't evolve to absorb such amount of information.  And while we find it fascinating it also breeds a certain form of anxiety}} #symp-fomo{{(such as, but not limited to, FOMO.)}}

Am I missing out on tons of new information?  Yup.  And I being entertained less?  Yup.  Am I seeing fewer beautiful women everyday?  Yup.  Is life less stimulating?  Yup.

I don't fear that I'm missing out because I know I'm missing out.  And I'm perfectly ok with that.

#title:{{Tips on how I completed a 30 day "no-surf challenge"}} #permalink:/r/nosurf/comments/8h3fa2/tips_on_how_i_completed_a_30_day_nosurf_challenge/, #created:1525475296 

#post{{4 months ago I did my first 30 day internet fast and let me just say, it was a life-altering experience. It was both difficult, scary, enjoyable and empowering.  This month I am doing another "no-surf challenge" and thought I would write share some of the tips that I feel help.

I won't get into the why's of my 30 day no-surf challenges, as the purpose of this post is just to give you guys some tips that work for me. 

Before I get into my tips, I feel it's important to define exactly what my "internet fast" consisted of as I didn't remove myself from the internet entirely as my career does not permit that.

The key is to distinguish between "mindless" internet activity and "mindful" internet activity.  Like anything else, the internet is not inherently bad, but is easily be abused.  It's like alcohol or weed.  They aren't bad, but if you find yourself binging on them they are.  

My mindless internet use is comprised mainly of Reddit, YouTube, with about 10% #a-t-tv-and-movies{{Netflix}}.  I use a #tech-track-time{{Google plug-in call TimeStats}} that records and graphs my internet use as it has been proven that humans have a pretty faulty memory when it comes to how we spend our time.

With my vices known, the rules of my "internet fast" stated that I could not visit any website in which I knew I was susceptible to abusing.  These were any site that were "networked" or worked primarily off a "suggestion engine."  Reddit, YouTube, Pinterest, any and all social media, Tumblr, #a-t-imgur{{Imgur}}, ect.  And NO PORN.  I also made the rule of "no computer use" after 5 pm as I wanted to see how eliminating screen time after 5 pm would affect my circadian rhythm and sleep cycle.

You might notice that computer video games are not on the restriction list.  That is because I don't play video games.  It's just not my thing.  I point this out because it's important to realize that everyone's vices are different and you have to be honest with yourself and customize your "fast" to your individual habits.  

Now, onto the tips:

**#1: YOU GOTTA DO IT FOR 30 DAYS**

I feel this rule is key.  The beauty of doing it for 30 days is that you really get a sense of what life outside the grip of the internet is like.  In the beginning your mind is kind of in shock.  It lived inside the internet for so long that being away from it is a surreal experience.  But as the weeks go by the dust starts to settle and you start to see life differently.  But this takes time and I feel 3 days or 7 days is just not long enough.  

And while a new habit on average takes 66 days (https://jamesclear.com/new-habit) to form, I feel that 30 days is a good starting point.  It's long enough to where it's difficult to complete, but not long that you just throw your hands up and give up. 

**#2 IT IS GOING TO BE BORING...REALLY BORING**

I'm not going to lie to you.  #withdrawal-bored{{You will be bored}}.  But that's the point.  The point of this challenge is to become reacquainted with the feeling.  One of the reasons we reach for our phone to scroll through our social media feed's or jump on Reddit is because the feeling of boredom makes us anxious.  We just don't feel "right" and jumping into the warm waters of The Bay of Stimulation eases that anxiety.

But the only way to get to the otherside of internet addiction is to walk through the negative emotion that is causing that addiction.  

Feeling into this boredom also teaches you how to deal with the feeling.  Instead of running from it as is our societies default action, you'll learn how to sit with it.  

#ben-less-frustration{{Waiting in line at the store, sitting behind some 100 year old in traffic, or waiting for your 5 year old to put tie their shoes will become less and less infuriating.  }}

**#3: #tech-do-other-things{{WRITE DOWN A LIST OF THINGS TO DO}}**

Now that you have eliminated your "default activity", that thing you do when you don't know what to do, you need to create new activities.  Because if you're not filling your time with something you WILL relapse.  And then you'll feel defeated and like a failure and no one wants that. 

So write down some things that you'd like to do or learn.  I wrote down a list and pinned it onto my cork board by my door.  

Some of the items were:

* Paint 
* Draw
* Practice guitar
* Go for a hike / walk
* Meditate
* Read
* Write in journal
* Organize workshop / work in workshop
* Clean room / House
* Organize pantry

You will be AMAZED at how much productive shit you can do when the internet is not part of your life.

**#4: GO TO BED: YOU CAN'T SURF IF YOU'RE UNCONSCIOUS**

My surfing addiction was the worst at night.  I could spend the hours of 8pm to 1 am surfing without a problem.  But I would wake up feeling like trash and later than I would like in the morning.

During my fasts I put the computer away at 5pm.  This allows my brain to settle down from the hours of 5-9pm.  By that time I feel calm and sleep, especially after a meditation session.  

If I go to sleep at 9 pm I can wake up at 5 am with relative ease.  I won't say waking up at 5 am is easy, but it's not painful.  In the morning I am full of energy and want to be productive. 

**#5: OUR CULTURE/SOCIETY WILL FIGHT YOU**

You'd think that people would commend you for your self-control and desire to better yourself.  I found this not to be the case.  It's not that people actively tried to sabotage my efforts, but they felt that blacklisting many of the most popular places online was too extreme.  

You have to realize the reason for this resistance.  If people agree that using these sites too much is a problem for you, then their subconscious is confronted with the question of "are these sites bad for me?"  And most people don't want to think this. 

We live increasingly isolated lives and our TV shows, video games, social media activity, ect. acts as a kind of "fill in" for that lack of community.  One of the things I realized when I cut out the internet was just how empty my life was.  It was painful to experience.  But pain is what gets our attention.  

And when other people see you eliminating these habits they get defensive because they don't want to imagine life without the crutch of the internet.  They don't even want to think about it.  

So instead they call you crazy, or say that you are weak because you can't "control yourself."

When people question you just know that the real person they are pushing back on is themselves.  }}




#title:{{I spent 30 days off Reddit and Youtube! So can you}} #permalink:/r/nosurf/comments/8onc86/i_spent_30_days_off_reddit_and_youtube_so_can_you/, #created:1528166710 

#post{{30 days ago I was addicted to Reddit.  Plain and simple.  Reddit and YouTube to be precise.  

There was always something new.  Always.  And it wasn't trite.  It was interesting stuff.  I'd learn things like, the weapons that almost were in WWII, the history of the color yellow, or why great white sharks can't be held in captivity.

I was at an all\-you\-can\-eat cognitive buffet.  

But our mind isn't like our stomach.  Our stomach has a point at which it is physically restricted from taking anything else in.  Our minds do not have an "off\-switch".  

But throughout history they haven't needed to.

Learning throughout history was mainly limited to your immediate surroundings.  You'd learn about the people in your village.  You'd learn about your enemies who live a few miles over the ridge.  You'd learn about when the river was ripe for fishing.  

Learning new things was relatively rare, so when a new thing presented itself, the system rewarded the brain for seeking out and finding that novel information.  Finding new information literally IS a drug for all organic life.  

And this is why places like Reddit and YouTube, among others, are so addictive and easy to let get out of control.  Because our brains CRAVE new things.  And that is the currency of Reddit and Youtube.  New content.  Content that will "hook" the user...which is you.

Their job is to get you to use these sites as much as possible and for AS LONG AS possible.

While I was on this "30 day fast" Reddit did a dramatic change to their site.  It was cool to see Reddit in a different format, but I was concerned to see infinite scroll added to the homepage.  If reddit was easy to get lost in before, it's even easier to now.  Something the developers know.   

Well, 30 days ago I was bringing on novelty.  

So I asked myself, "what would happen if you didn't go on either site for a month?"  

Now, you might be wondering, "ok, but how bad was your Reddit / Youtube addiction?"  

Well, I would check it in bed in the morning, as a "getting up ritual."  Check out the homepage, see if I had any messages, maybe browse a couple pages.  Then I might glance at the homepage on my phone while sitting at a light in traffic on the way to work.  I'd get to my desk and check the account I have for my work computer \(no NSFW stuff\) before diving into my emails.  I'd get done with emails, and check it again before getting into something else. 

But the thing is, everything during my day seemed to be sandwiched with "Reddit / Youtube checks." 

It was as if I had to wash my mouth out with it after any thing I did that I didn't absolutely enjoy.  I couldn't stand the taste of normal work without the carrot of Reddit on the other side. 

Then I'd get home and spent often my entire night either on YouTube, or Netflix, or Reddit, or a combination of all three at once.

I felt like that kid at the buffet who is stuffing pizza, and cupcakes, and icecream in his mouth all at the same time.

So I said, "just no more.  No Reddit.  No YouTube.  No Porn videos"

"Woah!  where did porn come in?"  You're thinking.  I figured since I was "fucking with the machine" I may as well throw no porn videos in there as well.  Really test it out. 

Well, I did it.  I went a month without being on Reddit.  Didn't look at the homepage once.  

**SO WHAT DID I LEARN?**

1. **When you aren't spending your time surfing online consuming content, you start to produce content.** 

I've been an "artist" for as long as I can remember.  My earliest memories are of me drawing, and it's always been something I've been talented at.

But I wasn't creating much when I had my Reddit routine.  I was consuming TONS of art, but producing none.  Everytime I fired up the computer or phone, I would see the current work of the worlds most amazing artists.  All at the tap of a finger.  Instantaneously. 

But what I learned was that consuming perfect art every single day, while not creating, is very tough on the soul.  You start to think that you don't do anything.  That any artist is worth what they put out, and not only are you not producing stuff on par with what you see online, you don't put anything out period.  

#other-activities-art{{In the last 30 days I have gotten heavily into 3D sculpting}}.  All the art I've ever done has been 2D.  I've done Architectural 3D modeling for a few years, but never sculpture.  

I now spend hours sculpting in this program, learning the in's and out's of this incredibly powerful and complex software.  But I am creating.  I am seeing my own work on the page.  And it's not instantaneous and effortless.  It's frustrating and slow, but ultimately fills me with incredible self worth.

**2. You learn why surfing is so addicting**

Browsing the web and social media is so addicting because of it's effort to dopamine ratio.  

Our brain decides on any action buy asking three questions.  What is the reward?  What is the effort required?  And what is the risk?

You see it's not that being online all the time, or watching your favorite TV show, or playing video games is all that highly enjoyable.  I think what makes them so addictive is that they give off a slow drip of dopamine for virtually zero effort and posing zero risk.

To get the neurochemicals of painting a picture you need to get the stuff to paint, decide on what to paint and how to paint it, spend the time painting, and hopefully it turns out how you imagined and you feel good. 

Or you could go on pinterest, look at pictures of amazing paintings that took artists hours to create and years of practice, and get a dopamine hit within seconds.  And then click another picture.  And then another.  And another. And...you get the picture.

You can spend hours in this trance of dopamine.  Your brain thinking it's being creative. 

Instead of buying nice clothes, showering, doing your hair, going to a social meeting, and talking to women, it's much easier to grab the bottle of lotion and look at porn. 

Sure porn isn't real women.  But you get your pick of literally hundreds of thousands of women that are 18.  All absolutely gorgeous.  

If you tire, even for a second of one of them, there is another one waiting in a thumbnail right next to her.  Ready to fight for your attention and pleasure.

It's like we are norman Kings enjoying the spoils of war.  

The fact that to gain enjoyment with the internet, one has only to sit in front of it.  It will do the rest and keep you entertained for the rest of your life if you let it.

**3.  I don't know what is going on in the world...and I love it**

Now for some people this is somewhat controversial, but I have no clue what is going on in the world, and I love it.  I don't know if there has been some sexual scandal, I don't know if our president has said some dumb ass remark in the past 14 seconds, I haven't heard about some catastrophic finding about the worlds oceans, or about the latest shooting.

But my thing is this.  For the entirety of time, humans didn't know this shit.  What we knew about was our current surroundings.  We knew about how to navigate our environment safely.  We knew about the news in our family and village.  

We didn't know about political coups in the forests of Zimbabwe.  We didn't know about .5 in of ice melting from under the arctic.  

We didn't know about the village across the country that all died because a methane leak popped up while they were sleeping.

There have always been horrible things that happened and horrible things will continue to happen.  But this is the only time in HUMAN FUCKING HISTORY \(let that sink in\) that knowing all this shit has been possible. 

Take the world 20 years from now.  What does it look like?  Now, lets say you died today and 20 years you look at the world.  Are those two worlds ANY different politically, environmentally, socially?  No.  Chances are good that not one thing would be different.  99.999999&amp;#37; make no difference. 

But here I was concerning myself with a bunch of bullshit.  Every fucking day I'd be listening, like a good drone, to the morning news on NPR.  I'd ready about stuff on Reddit.  I'd watch John Oliver on YouTube and be "informed."  And what changed?  Absolutely...fucking...nothing.  Zero.  Nada.  Zilch.  Here I was devoting lots, and getting nothing.  That is what Warren Buffet would refer to as, "a bad investment."

**4. The modern world requires us to say "no thank you, I'm good."**

More and more we are gonna be told to consume something.  Soon we're gonna be offered virtual reality as a pacifier to soothe the pains of real "boring" life.  And compared to the virtual world, real life will be boring.  It will be dull, like a color lacking saturation.  

The world today is telling us, "real life is painful, here buy a product."  And they're right.  Real life IS painful.  I'm not gonna lie and say it's not.  What I'm saying is man the fuck up and deal with it. 

I think we need to learn how to refrain from taking the pain killer.  I think we need to learn to live with the pain.  Because although pain isn't the most fun to deal with, it makes the good even better.  

And the truth of the matter is, being online all the time doesn't alleviate the pain completely.  It just puts the pain in different parts. }}
