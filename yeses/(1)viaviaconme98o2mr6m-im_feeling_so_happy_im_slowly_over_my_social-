#post{{I didn't use #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}} for nearly 2 months. I #tech-delete{{deleted all social media apps}}, just had them on browser with my profile logged out. I didn't feel like using them, since I'm a lazy person, and deleting the app version and logging out, did help, as there was a friction. I slowly got over the need to use Reddit. #ben-more-time{{Got more free time}}, #other-activities-journal{{I engaged in journalling, be it plant journalling, or writing about life or some nice quotes or whatever I learnt from a random book.}}

I've also created a bunch of self challenges, like no surf or no sugar for a week at least, I maintain an anonymous online blog for accountability, to write down how I feel before and after. 

#other-activities-exercise{{I also exercise without fail in the morning, it's an absolute necessity for a good mental health in my case.}} &lt;3

Just wanted to share, 2 months ago #symp-feel-bad{{I was a helpless person, sad and depressed}}, #ben-more-self-esteem{{I'm proud of myself that things are slowly aligning}}. I can do it, so can you. &lt;3}}
