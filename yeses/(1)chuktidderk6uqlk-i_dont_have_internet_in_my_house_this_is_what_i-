#post{{I have a debilitating internet addiction. #tech-use-outside-internet{{I have a lockbox I put my phone and ethernet cable into before I go into my house}}. If I must bring my ethernet cable into my home, I only do it before I go to work (if I desperately need to download something), and I put it back into the lockbox when I'm going to work. I almost never bring my phone or ethernet into my house after work because I will, without fail, #symp-worse-sleep{{stay up into the late hours browsing #a-t-youtube{{youtube}}/ #a-t-reddit{{reddit}}/ #a-t-news{{news}} sites until late into the night}}, #symp-worse-sleep{{making me sleep deprived and ruining my day}}.

When I keep internet away from my home, I can #ben-better-sleep{{sleep normally}}, and I feel way #ben-clear-mind{{less brain fog}}.

What do I do without internet then? How do I keep myself occupied? Well, #tech-do-other-things{{I have multiple things setup that are offline only, and can still stimulate my mind.}}

1)#other-activities-contemplative{{ Kindle with multiple e-books.}} I keep a list of things that interest me and download more every couple months
2) #other-activities-offline-games{{Nintendo switch with deep strategy offline games like Civ 6, Divinity Original Sin II, and Slay the Spire}}
3) #other-activities-journal{{Notebook and Pencils to doodle and journal and plan my day}}
4) #other-activities-offline-games{{Laptop with offline steam games}} like Borderlands 3, Age of empires II definitive edition, dead cells, hades, etc.
5) #other-activities-offline-games{{Solo board games like A Feast for Odin and Gaia Project}}
6) #other-activities-offline-games{{A big digital Tablet with offline games on it like Chess, Go, and Through the Ages, and I download a season of my favorite show every couple weeks with amazon prime for offline use only}}

Just some ideas. What do you guys do without internet? How do you keep occupied?}}
