#post{{I thought I’d do a little update post, one month on since I #tech-delete{{deleted my socials}}. When I say “socials” I mean #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}} and #a-t-facebook{{FB}}. I haven’t used Snapchat in years and I deleted TikTok ages ago. I still use Reddit, but I see it more of a forum that I don’t feel like I get addicted to.

Honestly, I can’t believe it’s been only a month! I feel like I haven’t been there for years. Which just speaks volumes of how much I used it, and how much the clutter in these apps was affecting me.

I didn’t know how I’d cope; would I go back to it or not?! #bad-lose-contact{{I am missing one or two of my groups}}, but I don’t miss all the posts from my “friends” or all the pages that I’ve like over the last 13 years, or all the shit in general on there.

Bottom line - there is hope for anyone thinking of doing this! If I can do it, so can you. It will take willpower at first, but after a while you will love the #ben-misc{{less noisy life}}!}}
