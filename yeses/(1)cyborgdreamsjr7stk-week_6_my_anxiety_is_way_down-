I started my 'digital detox' a little more than 3 weeks ago. Here's what I've done so far:

&amp;#x200B;

\\- #tech-logout{{Logged out}} of #a-t-facebook{{facebook}} and #tech-delete{{deleted the app from my phone}}. I only log in every few days to check notifications for 30 seconds.

\\- #tech-delete{{Deleted}} #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}} app from phone. I pretty much only go on \/r\/nosurf now.

\\- Deleted #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}} app. That one wasn't really a problem for me, but I found the ads creepy and figured I don't really need it.

\\- Use #tech-youtube-extension{{DF Tube on browser}} to block Youtube's recommendations, feeds, and comment section.

\\- Use #tech-youtube-extension{{NewPipe on Android}} to do the same (and it blocks ads too!)

\\- Use #tech-misc{{Ublock Origin to block youtube ads in browser}} (and tons of other ads and creepy data collection tools)

\\- #tech-stop-notifications{{Blocked notifications on android for everything except email, DMs, text, and banking apps.}}

\\- #tech-unsubscribe{{Unsubscribed from most email newsletters (a.k.a. ads)}}

\\- #tech-other-time-checking{{Turned on the always-on display on my Note 9 so I can check the time without unlocking my phone. Unlocking it can trigger compulsions.}}

\\- #tech-make-less-attractive{{Changed browser homepages on PC and Android to blank so I'm not bombarded with news articles and ads every time I open a new browser window\/tab}}

\\- #tech-misc{{Use Tab Limiter browser extension to limit the amount of open tabs to 3.}}

&amp;#x200B;

I know that's a lot, but I believe all these steps have benefited me. Not keeping up with election news and the social media buzz surrounding it is awesome - I know who I'm voting for anyway, #ben-see-less-negativity{{so why expose myself to that much negativity}}? I did that last election and it was really depressing and scary.

It's also nice to not know what the 'scandal of the week' is - you know, whatever dumb thing the internet wants you to be mad at \/ afraid of this week, which may or may not even be true. I never fell for the actual fear mongering, but I would become obsessed with debunking it and being mad at the people who spread it. So whether you're mad because you believe the scandal of the week, or you're upset that people are spreading untrue\/misleading\/exaggerated information designed to make people angry and afraid, you're still #symp-feel-bad{{feeling bad and negative}}. And it's better to just not be exposed to it in the first place.

#withdrawal-time{{One thing I'm still dealing with is the compulsion to look at facebook}}. I don't give in to it most of the time, but whenever I open the browser on my phone, a voice in my head says 'facebook' and a lot of times I'll catch myself typing it in to the browser and have to stop myself. I hope it goes away soon, but I guess it's to be expected after poisoning my mind with it all these years.

Hope you guys are benefitting from your nosurf journey as well.

#post{{Hey everyone! I want to give an update on my digital detox. [Here is a link to my post where I listed all the measures I took.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/j6wvoa/week_3_still_having_compulsions/)

&amp;#x200B;

My brain has been getting stuck in endless thought loops for the past year or so, and the pandemic made it worse. About a week ago (5 weeks of digital detox), I noticed that #ben-stopped-ruminating{{I had stopped getting stuck in thought loops}}, and #ben-less-anxiety{{my anxiety went down by a lot}}. The problems that I was worried about still exist, but they're no longer controlling my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't even experience that much anxiety in regards to the election (I'm American), much to my surprise. I voted, and after that I checked the results a couple of times a day on google. Didn't watch any commentary, or read any social media posts, or watch any TV news regarding the election. Just looked at google to see if there was a winner yet, and turned it off after I saw the status. Last election I was an anxious mess.

&amp;#x200B;

As for what I'll do moving forward, I'm going to keep doing most of the things on the list from above, with the exception of Reddit. I think it's safe to start re-introducing Reddit, but I will unsubscribe from all subs except for hobbies &amp; special interest related subs. And I'll turn off notifications and sub recommendations. }}
