#post{{About 8 months ago I was appalled to find that I spent almost 40 hours a week on my phone. I read #book-digital-minimalism{{Digital Minimalism}} and #book-deep-work{{Deep Work}}, did the #tech-misc{{30 detox[[me: ie, the one recommended in digital minimalism]]}}, and decreased my social media usage substantially.

My usage gradually increased over time, but thankfully not to the same level as before. Defaulting to #tech-delete{{having my apps uninstalled}} and #tech-blocker-screentime{{Screen Time restrictions}} had become the norm.

I recently went to a friend’s funeral and it made me reconsider many things. I had been in quite the slump since she first began dying, and my search for meaning had been pushed aside for the easier route of relishing in the dopamine highs of the moment, whether that happened to be alcohol, sex, or social media.

In response, I recently put another embargo on all social media apps. I replaced them with reading and/or watching an episode of a short show. No concrete rules, no length of time, just don’t log in. 

I know now that my mind will initially resist. I always go through a spell of intense depression at first, like all of my compounded loneliness has surged back to the forefront. My friend’s death compounded it.

But that was temporary. I confided in a friend who directed me to be creative. I didn’t log back in to quell the feeling. Once I made it through that wall, things slowly became brighter.

#ben-productive{{I haven’t been this productive in a long time}}. Because of the increased reading and #ben-better-attention{{extended focus on tasks}}, I was able to increase my working sessions from less than 20 minutes to over an hour in around a week. I’ve been working swiftly, #ben-cleaner{{keeping my room tidy}}, and #ben-better-sleep{{getting to bed at a decent hour}}.  I’m noticing #ben-face-difficulties{{a general tendency to push through when something is hard rather than taking a break}} immediately when I face a problem (You know the feeling).

Just popped in to remind you that focus is a muscle, and leading the life you want is not an on/off switch, but a journey. Your muscles will grow, you will learn, and you will keep moving forward, so long as you try.}}
