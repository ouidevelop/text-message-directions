#post{{Hey all, this post is going to be pretty informal and off the cuff. I didn't really plan this out but I hope it will be useful to someone. If you have any questions feel free to ask or pm.

So about a year ago I started realizing that I was spending way too much time on the internet. #symp-wasted-time{{It was consuming all of my free time}} and #symp-feel-bad{{I never enjoyed real life. I always had a slight feeling of gloom and dissatisfaction}}. After doing some looking into dopamine, one thing led to another and I realized that constant browsing might be my problem.

Once I figured this out, #tech-use-outside-internet{{I decided to move out on my own and NOT hook up the internet}}. It was just me, a #tech-dumbphone{{dumbphone}} (no data), and a library card for books/internet use once a day.

At first the free time was a killer. #withdrawal-restless{{I felt like I was starting to go slightly crazy and was breaking stuff, pacing around the house like a madman, getting angry at nothing, etc}}. But then I started to realize how long the days were. #other-activities{{I started reading}}, #other-activities{{cleaning}}, #other-activities{{cooking}}, #other-activities{{studying}}, #other-activities{{exercising}}, #other-activities{{spending time outdoors just looking at the lake for no reason}}. #ben-notice-more{{I started noticing the seasons more, the humidity, the cool air in fall. Etc.}} #ben-being-present{{Everything just became more present.}}

#ben-better-social-skills{{I also learned to communicate much better with other people, even relatives. It was great.}} And also, even without home internet, #ben-misc{{I felt more connected to society than ever}}. I was listening to the news on the radio every hour, I was checking newspapers, I was going out and about.

So those are all great benefits and stuff, but recently I learned that an ISP near me was doing month-to-month internet plans, so I decided to sign up for one month just to see what having internet again was like, now that I finally realized what a normal life is supposed to be like.

I noticed that #symp-less-self-controll{{I felt trapped inside my house because of how compelling the internet was}}. I stopped going outside. #symp-less-clean{{I stopped cleaning and cooking. My floors became super dirty}}. #symp-bored{{Days became bland}}.

And also, despite having the internet at home, I was actually less connected to it and society than ever. Instead of using it beneficially, I was just #a-t-games{{playing browser games}}, watching endless #a-t-tv-and-movies{{tv shows}}, and wasting time on joke subreddits and on streaming video sites like #a-t-twitch{{twitch.tv}}.

When I used the internet once a day at the library, I would load up reddit and actually read all the links on the front few pages and actually read the articles of the interesting stuff, and research them further as well (science stuff, tech stuff, cool AMA's, etc). But once I had the internet at home, I stopped doing that. I browsed #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}} more than ever, but only for the jokes and puns, and the low effort picture posts. I stopped doing any research and stopped caring about the cool stuff that required learning.

I stopped watching new movies from redbox because "i have all the movies ever made through torrents" but I never even watched them. Just the idea of having them was enough. I stopped caring about or enjoying music.

The only good thing I got from having the internet at home was that I found a cool new blog I never knew of before, but to be honest, I'm pretty sure I would have found it at the library too because I found it through google and I would have used that same search string there as well.

So all in all, I would consider the experiment of reconnecting the internet to be a huge success in that it proved to me why I don't have it in the first place. So I am disconnecting it again and for good this time.}}
