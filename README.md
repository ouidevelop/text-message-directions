This is a service that provides text message based info for people who don't have a smart phone or don't have data. I know this works for USA and Canada.

You have to send a text message to 1 (312) 313-1234 with the right format depending on what you want

# Directions
Use the form `[drive or walk or bike or transit] from [origin] to [destination]`.
For example:
`drive from UC berkeley to Oakland airport`
`transit from los angeles airport to santa monica`
`bike from santa monica to venice beach`

# Contact info
Use the form `info for [place]` to get the phone number and address of a business.
For example:
`info for uc berkeley`.

Use the form `find [type of place] near [specific place]` to get up to 20 nearby places.
For example:
`find grocery near uc berkeley`.

# Weather
Use the form `weather to [zip or postal code]`.
For example:
`weather for 10017`
