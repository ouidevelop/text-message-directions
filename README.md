This is a service that provides text message based info for people who don't have a smart phone or don't have data. I know this works for USA and Canada.

You have to send a text message to 1 (312) 313-1234 with the right format depending on what you want

# Directions

`bike from santa monica to venice beach`

# Contact info
Use the form `info [place]` to get the phone number and address of a business.

For example:

Use the form `find [type of place] near [specific place]` to get up to 5 nearby places.

For example:

This project costs me about 10 cents per message (on average). As I'm not trying to make a profit, that is what I charge. Here's how to get set up:
1. Buy as many messages as you want. 100 messages would be 10$, 50 would be 5$ etc.

2. Send me an email at ouidevelop@gmail.com telling me your phone number and how much you paid and I'll add your messages to your number.
