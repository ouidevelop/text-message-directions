This is a service that provides text message based info for people who don't have a smart phone or don't have data. I know this works for USA and Canada.

You have to send a text message to 1 (312) 313-1234 with the right format depending on what you want

# Directions
Use the form `[drive or walk or bike or transit] from [origin] to [destination]`.

For example:

`drive from UC berkeley to Oakland airport`

`transit from los angeles airport to santa monica`

`bike from santa monica to venice beach`

# Contact info
Use the form `info for [place]` to get the phone number and address of a business.

For example:

`info for uc berkeley`

Use the form `find [type of place] near [specific place]` to get up to 20 nearby places.

For example:

`find grocery near uc berkeley`

# Weather
Use the form `weather for [zip or postal code]`

For example:

`weather for 10017`

# Payment 

This project costs money every time it sends or receives a text message. I use a "pay what you want" model to cover costs. If you want to use the service, you have 4 options:
1. Sign up for monthly donations on paypal (I think the minimum is 1 dollar per month).  
[![paypal](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=YLQFA7GD6GZYG&lc=US&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted)
2. Sign up for payments on patreon: https://www.patreon.com/ouidevelop
3. If you'd like to pay but can't with those two methods for some reason, email me at ouidevelop@gmail.com.
4. If you can't pay feel free to shoot me an email at ouidevelop@gmail.com. I may be able to let you use the thing for free. No promises though.

When you sign up for a payment, send me a message with your phone number so I can add you to the whitelist.
