This is a service that provides text message based info for people who don't have a smart phone or don't have data. I know this works for USA and Canada.

You have to send a text message to 1 (312) 313-1234 with the right format depending on what you want

# Directions
The form should be `[mode] from [origin] to [destination]`. For example: `drive from UC berkeley to Oakland airport`. The possible modes of transportation are 'drive', 'walk', 'bike', and 'transit'.

# Contact info
You can also get the phone number and address of a businesse with the format `info for [place]`. For example `info for uc berkeley`.

You can get up to 20 nearby places with `find [type of place] near [specific place]`. For example: `find grocery near uc berkeley`.

# Weather
Use the form: "weather for 55555" (with your zip/postal code instead of 55555) 

# Donation
This project costs money every time it sends or receives a text message. If you'd like to help the project keep running, feel free to donate here:
