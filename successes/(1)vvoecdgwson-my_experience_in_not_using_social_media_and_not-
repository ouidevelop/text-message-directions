#post{{I have cleared my social accounts on #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}} and #a-t-twitter{{Twitter}} since 2013. also, in the same year, i start to not surf the web, except for #a-t-youtube{{youtube}} and little time on #a-t-reddit{{reddit}}. I stayed like this until 2017 when I registered again on #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}} and created a #a-t-snapchat{{Snapchat}} account and start to surf again.  I do not post anything on my Facebook, but I use it to follow some of the posts that are available only by registration.

 Conclusion: You remain out of coverage, and you do not know what is going on around you, but it is useful for staying in #ben-less-anxiety{{serenity and peace}}.}}
