#post{{**Background** 

We moved to a new house at the end of January and our internet supplier had trouble setting us up, #tech-no-home-internet{{so we have been without internet at home for seven weeks (back online yesterday)}}. I thought you might be curious how it went.

Husband works and is out the house 9am to 7pm. I look after our six-month-old baby at home and I am job hunting. #tech-limited-data{{I have 1GB on my phone per month}}. We have a smart TV and only watch catch-up or #a-t-tv-and-movies{{Netflix}} #a-t-tv-and-movies{{Amazon Prime}}.

#tech-no-home-internet{{We are members of the local library which offers internet access and my in-laws live a 40-minute walk away, so I used their internet access when necessary.}}

I’ve been interested in nosurf and the simple living community for a while. I also like budgeting and living frugally so this post will address these themes. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Bills**

Moving into a new home means setting up utilities. Most utility companies contacted us via post so I had phone numbers to call and I could set up accounts this way. 

I had a lot of difficulty with insurance (car and pet insurance). Our renewal on the car was £ 1700 this year. I called the company, but they wouldn’t budge. We received advertisements in the post from various insurance companies, when I called for a quote it would take around 30 minutes. The most expensive was £4000 and the cheapest was £1300. I phoned 5 suppliers, so it took about 3 hours over the course of a week. It was a waste of time. I did a price comparison on the internet; it took 30 minutes and I got a price of £1030 from our current provider. When my husband called, he got it down to £1000. Internet very important for this!

&amp;#x200B;

**Banking / Budgeting**

We use online banking and we have about six accounts between us. I use an online budgeting system to keep track of savings and spending. Pretty much impossible without internet so I did this at my in-laws.

&amp;#x200B;

**TV**

As mentioned at the top we don’t watch live television and with no internet we couldn’t access any shows. When we had internet access we’d watch a few shows in the morning, I’d watch two episodes during the afternoon of a drama then the TV would stay on the rest of day for ‘background noise’.

We do have a lot of DVDs so now during the morning we’d watch one episode of something light then no TV until after baby was asleep. We’d put on a movie or watch an episode or two of a comedy show. Sometimes husband would play a video game and I’d do my own thing. 

We were a little afraid of missing out on shows/youtube but from the looks of things we didn’t miss anything. We had people asking if we’d seen trailers or TV shows etc but we just said “no, what happens?” and it was all good. 

Husband missed watching #a-t-youtube{{youtube}} whilst shaving or when in the kitchen. He replaced this with music and would sing/dance with baby.

We had friends visiting and they didn’t mind the lack of tv but family commented on how quiet it was a few times. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Sleep**

I had interrupted sleep due to baby but I was up frequently for the first four weeks even without that. A combination of anger at the internet company (we had a lot of broken promises) and stress. Things turned a corner after four weeks and we now sleep great. This was around the time we stopped TV during the day. I go to bed at 9pm, up at 6am and husband sleeps 11pm to 7am. Baby sleeps 8pm to 7am, he sometimes has a brief cry but goes back to sleep on his own within a minute or so.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Eating**

We used to eat watching TV with food in our laps despite having a dining table. Since no internet we eat at the table for breakfast and dinner. Table is in the kitchen, we have no TV playing and I aim to have dinner on the table for when husband walks in. If dinner is taking a while I set a pot of tea on the table for husband and he’ll sit in the kitchen chatting. Baby is in a high chair at the table. 

We’ve dabbled in leftovers before. Before baby was born we made a big pot of mashed potato and froze portions. I’m in charge of cooking so I set up a shopping list and meal plan for the week. I usually make extras now and freeze the leftovers. Baby’s food is made from scratch and frozen too. During the day I make food in advance so if we are having chips the potatoes can be cut and put in cold water until needed. 

We used to have six to ten take aways a month due to my laziness. I’d leave making food too late or one of us had a bad day. We would order from Just Eat or Dominios. The ease of ordering food from a phone was a big factor. We’ve had three take aways in the past seven weeks – two as a treat at the beginning and one last week because I had a job fair and it was late by the time it finished. 

#bad-practical-difficulties{{I miss finding recipes online.}} We took out some recipe books from the library and took photos of the ones we liked the look of but its not the same.

**Mental Health**

I didn’t have any mental health problems with the internet. Without the internet for #withdrawal-time{{the first few weeks}} #withdrawal-irritable{{I was impatient}}. Setting up accounts involved listening to five minutes of “it’s quicker to use our website” and sometimes I’d have trouble getting through to the right people. As mentioned, we had trouble with our internet provider and I was angry over that too. I watched the clock a lot waiting for husband to come home. Baby naps for 30 minutes a time and I’d be annoyed when he woke up whilst I was playing a video game or reading a post etc.

But #ben-misc{{there is a turning point where you get very zen}}. #ben-feel-better{{I’ve had several people comment on how smiley baby and I am the last few weeks}}. #ben-more-patient{{I think I’m more patient with baby}} and its #ben-better-social-life{{good to chat without one person being on their phone}}. You also notice people on phones a lot more.

&amp;#x200B;

#bad-practical-difficulties{{**Job Hunting**
Next to impossible with no internet.}} I went to a job fair but was told to apply to positions online. I haven’t canvassed the neighbourhood, but I have seven years’ experience in logistics so I’m looking for something specific.

&amp;#x200B;

**Phone**

We both have smart phones. I use whats app and facebook messenger to send photos and videos to family and friends since we moved away five years ago and moved further still. I spent a lot of time on #a-t-news{{news websites}} and #a-t-reddit{{reddit}}. Maybe three – four hours a day. A few minutes here and there adds up. I’d surf whilst feeding baby, during his naps, whilst making his bottles.

I still used my phone for phone calls, texts and I have 1GB of data which was mainly used on getting phone numbers and checking out jobs. I have an offline puzzle game on my phone I play while baby has a bottle. It has lives that fill up every 30 minutes to a maximum of 7 lives so it fits in well. 

My phone provider offers treats like cheap cinema tickets or food vouchers which I missed but it wasn’t a bit deal.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hobbies**

We didn’t do much when we had the internet. I’d walk the dog for an hour a day.

Since no internet #other-activities-groups{{we’ve joined a few baby groups}}, #other-activities-groups{{I go to a board game group every two weeks}} and #other-activities-walk{{the dog gets walked two hours a day}}. I#other-activities-read{{’m reading a lot of books}} and I’ve taken up #other-activities-knitting{{knitting}}. I’ve stopped playing video games entirely. #other-activities-cook{{I’m definitely more into cooking now.}} I’m also planning to take baby swimming in the near future.

&amp;#x200B;

**Closing Thoughts**

TLDR; This is probably more about less TV when I read it back. I think mindlessly watching screens or using the internet had a negative impact that I didn’t fully acknowledge until I stopped. The internet is a useful tool though. I also thought more about being a mindless consumer of the internet which is why this is my first reddit post in three years of using the site every day! 

I'd like to do an update in a few months about how things have changed since we got the internet back if there is any interest. }}
