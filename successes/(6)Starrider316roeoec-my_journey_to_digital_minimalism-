#post{{What I did so far:

# One week of screen fast

#tech-out-of-sight{{Just turned around every screen at home to face the wall}}. The TV actually looks nicer this way. Gone is the huge black mirror staring into your soul every evening.

# Rearranged the living room

Once the TV had been turned, the sofa is no longer was need in front of the TV. The focal point is now the digital piano. And it looks much nicer placed in the room like grand instead of being fit to the wall.

# #tech-grayscale{{Turning every screen I have into grayscale mode}} (PC, tablet, phone and of course TV)

That's absolutely powerful. I'm still able to do everything I have to. From finances to sharing photos with friends (even when I only see them in black and white). But reality looks so much more colorful now. Even a book with a colored cover looks more attractive than the screen. I liked to watch people do stuff in Canadian forests on YouTube every day, but that feels as fake as it really is.

I also have to re-play all my favorite video games in black &amp; white now (just kidding).

# #tech-make-less-attractive{{Removing all wallpapers from every device}}

Even my favorites black &amp; white nature photos had to go. They make the device feel like a natural livable space, while in fact it's just hostile technology. Don't look at images of vividly green forests while being stuck in an urban environment, go to one.

# #tech-misc{{Focusing on subverting habits, not removing them}}

I've not seen much success with removing habits, but subverting them does very well so far. Turning the TV instead of disposing it (easier choice to make), making it harder to sit in front of a screen, make the screen content look much less enticing, instead of blocking apps.

I'm sure my habits will adjust accordingly.}}

#post{{Offline is the new normal

Since Feb 28th #tech-use-outside-internet{{my home Internet subscription ended}}. (On my job I don't use the Internet.) This is what happened since:

Similar to the new #tech-dumbphone{{"offline phone"}} I got a new separate #tech-misc{{"offline computer"}}: A new machine both as a reward for staying sober as well as to keep the old habits and the old apps with the old hardware. Setting it up was a challenge though, especially figuring out online activation. (Worked it out by backing everything up, getting it on public Wi-Fi, backing up everything again, then rolling the entire system image back to the offline state and figuring out restoring the activation files from the backup.)

Offline became the new normal, online the exception, life at home feels like 1999 again. Without Wi-Fi internet access #tech-limited-data{{my phones quickly ran out of data}} and went offline naturally - That worked better than expected! People still message me on Whatsapp assuming that I'm still online, the latest message reached on the supermarket wi-fi. When people message me there, I text back using SMS, because for that I don't pay anything extra (for data I do). At home there is only manual 384 kbit/s USB internet stick dialup access to synchronize emails and banking transactions once a day. I have to be prudent to not waste that data package as well, so after transfering a few hundred kilobytes it goes back offline till the next day.

The occasional urge to look up "important" things online turned out to be just an urge to surf. So instead of giving in I postpone those things now, because I have no data to waste. Downloads and updates are added to a queue to be served by public Wi-Fi. Many things I figure out offline in the meantime. Live gets slower, nothing happens "instant" anymore.

#ben-misc{{My home feels like a private space again. That's the biggest change: When Zoom and the likes invaded into my living room in 2020, it felt like it turned into some sort of public space, violating my privacy.}} That feeling has gone away since I cut the cord. That's the best change so far. With all screens switched to grayscale #ben-less-anxiety{{I could relax again}}, because without the online feed, screen time limits itself naturally: If you finished watching a DVD - you finished it, there is no "watch this now!". And there is only so much you can do on an "offline computer", before it gets boring.

#ben-battery-life{{The battery life on all devices is amazing now}}! Phones last a week in standby, a tablet stays charged for a month, a computer runs for over ten hours on a single charge. And my car goes a hundred miles per gallon (just kidding). These devices were made to survive a constant feed of colorful scrolling media and without it they go forever and don't bother you with "recharge me!" What a relief.}}

#post{{People who know me assume I'm going to become some sort of monk. However my goal of cutting the cord was to go back into the year 1999, not into the year 1939 or 1899. Digital technology including the Internet existed back then but "going on-line" (with that spelling) at home was a special occasion, not the norm of being permanently connected to the grid. I got the impression that like the "Borg" from "Star Trek" many people feel distress when being disconnected from the hive mind and I wanted to stop the process of becoming just that.

So without access to the digital public at home, I obviously go outside more into the real public. And there the digital public is available as well, but only a limited amount of connectivity at a limited amount of places. I have to plan ahead to get things done this way. After doing my errands on the "information highway" I happily close the door behind me returning into privacy. You share the highway with other people, but unless you are a truck driver you don't live or sleep on the highway.

Spending home time without the Internet is something I do for months now: I completely quit #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}}, #a-t-podcast{{podcasts}} and the likes in November already. I was going without any screens for several weeks in December, then reintroduced them in grayscale. I started disconnecting all my devices from the Internet in January and finally canceled the expensive home uplink into the grid, because it just became redundant by the end of February.

The most notable effect was becoming a single tasker. Now that I have so much time at my hands, I can afford to do tasks one after another instead of in parallel like tabbed browsing. #ben-misc{{Instead of streaming music in the background, preparing a meal while watching YouTube, then eating in front of a screen, I enjoy going much slower in my free time.}} There is no background noise in my life anymore. Driving has become a task on its own, the radio is off.

And even when consuming screen content from physical media, the constant stream of digital novelty is still cut off. Just as it always has been with books and printed music. I noticed that I don't have to fight habits anymore, because my disconnected devices became neutered. Even when taking the tablet to bed, it still can't reach anything with it's Wi-Fi. Binge watching until 3am just won't happen anymore. The browser on it can only access offline pages - snapshots taken while on public Wi-Fi.

The guys I "knew" from YouTube became strangers again and there is no way to engage for hours in social media comments anymore.}}

#post{{WhatsApp gone - the last thing that kept me online

What happened so far:

Month 1: Quit YouTube
Month 2: Screen fast
Month 3: Quit color screens
Month 4: Quit home Internet (deleted Wi-Fi router)
Month 5: Quit phone Internet (deleted WhatsApp)

The past months were quite a journey. It all started with deleting the YouTube account and #tech-unsubscribe{{letting go of all subscriptions collected in over a decade}}. To get binge watching under control I did go on a screen fast before carefully reintroducing them in grayscale. I also introduced a new "offline-only" computer, which has never streamed a second of YouTube after leaving the factory and a new "offline-only" small screen phone without any connected apps installed.

After limiting home Internet access through the child protection feature of my Wi-Fi router to wired-only devices and a bandwidth below 384 kbit/s, I decided to cut the cord and drop home Internet access altogether. This was justified as traffic dropped by 95 %. That measure turned out being a great success: It entirely eradicated all surfing and made being offline the new normal.

A month later the only thing keeping me occasionally online was WhatsApp on the old phone. So after another month I deleted that, uninstalled the PC version as well and while underway #tech-delete{{cleaned that phone from all other connected apps - including browsers, weather apps and other stuff just meant to keep you checking stuff online}}. I can retire the old scrolling phone now as well as the old used-to-be binge-watch station - the complicated intermediate measures are no longer necessary.

While the withdrawal is certainly noticeable, a lifestyle with complete freedom from the Internet shackles is in reach now. I encountered much less resistance than expected and much less complications. When I started this journey I expected some "trying to live without the power grid" experience, while the reality was more like getting rid of your car: Life gets more inconvenient, you need to plan ahead more, but you can get by.

I won't miss the Internet.}}




#title:{{Offline is the new normal - getting into cooking}} #permalink:/r/nosurf/comments/u5rln5/offline_is_the_new_normal_getting_into_cooking/, #created:1650215859 

#post{{When I'm at home, I now have to think hard about reasons for going online: reasons for plugging in the USB Internet stick to waste precious megabytes from my small data package, reasons for using the Internet at 384 kbit/s, or reasons to seek a public Wi-Fi. Most of the time I can't find any. Everything I do works offline now. All my technology which used to cry for that tasty cloud every minute now works just fine being disconnected.

Seven weeks after cutting the cord, I don't have to come up with reasons to stay off the web now, instead I have to come up with reasons to connect to the Internet. As a digital minimalist I even started decluttering my wallet, which was full of smart cards - little computers built into what used to be credit cards with a magnetic strip and a signature - most of them I don't actually need. In fact I started using cash again.

#wow{{Half a year ago I was still using YouTube and watched a guy building a cabin and cooking freshly harvested food over an open fire - with me eating junk food in front of a screen.}} I felt inspired but thought I could never replicate that living in the midst of urban hell. But when you got no Internet at home and a working stove at your hands, you start getting ideas...

Remember when we used the early Internet to look up recipes? Ha, those never worked for me, so I quickly got back to processed meals. However without any online sources I was forced to make up my own. So I started with just throwing random stuff into the pot or pan, then refining through iterations. And that worked.

I stopped using color screens last year and I now shop fresh food by just looking at the color. Before it all looked the same to me, now I can tell what tastes good. When pulling something from storage I can tell if it's still edible by just looking at its color - no more best before anxiety.

It's mind-blowing where you end up once you decide to get rid of the big red play button...}}




#title:{{Offline is the new normal - cutting 4G}} #permalink:/r/nosurf/comments/uwmmpj/offline_is_the_new_normal_cutting_4g/, #created:1653383645 

#post{{After cutting the cord at home (canceling the landline Internet subscription), my only remaining Internet access were mobile devices and an 1 GB 384 kbit/s USB Internet stick (I have no Internet at work). My online time went down to a total of two hours per month in April and my screen times sunk accordingly, have a look at my screen time report:

https://old.reddit.com/r/digitalminimalism/comments/uhf1em/offline_is_the_new_normal_screen_time_report/

With almost no screen time in April #ben-better-social-life{{my social life exploded like never}} before and this continues into May - quite contrary to what social networks try to convey to you. #right-mind{{I also started noticing how weird it is that people are glued to their screens. My brain doesn't consider this behavior being "normal" anymore and now puts it into the "creepy" category.}}

However I still had to stay disciplined and watch the Internet not creeping back in at home. So I took it one step further and completely removed all devices capable of 4G access from my home and stored them in my car sitting nicely in a parking lot. Now my home phone is a Nokia 101 and my car phone is Nokia 108 with Bluetooth, while I have a collection of powered-off smart devices in the trunk. The only remaining screens at home are either not IP-capable at all or feature Wi-Fi only and can't reach anything with it. My home is now completely disconnected from the Internet - no exceptions.

The USB Internet stick also got moved to the car with a free 200 MB data package. It actually works there as a gas-powered Wi-Fi hotspot.

#ben-relief{{The willpower relief at home is huge. I can stop focusing on not doing something, when the option simply isn't available anymore.}} By weaning off Internet access instead of going cold turkey right away I could deal with and work around the necessities for Internet access. For example, emails are stored locally and synchronized here and there, my banking is probably going back to cash with over-the-counter service again. I also saved lots of money by not spending anything online. I didn't purchase any "digital goods" since 2021. I also mostly stopped using email and deleted some decades old email addresses which only saw spam anyway.}}
