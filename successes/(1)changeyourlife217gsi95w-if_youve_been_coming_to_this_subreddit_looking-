#post{{I really mean the title. Now let's get into it.

We all want the same thing here. To change our life. For the better. To be the best person possible. To enjoy life and all it has to offer. To be the most productive person so we can achieve our goals. And to enjoy the productivity, and not have it be out of sheer willpower.

Let's start with going back in time. Do you remember a time in your life when you could get lost in a book? When you could power through any book effortlessly? Not only that, but your teachers or parents would have to get you to stop reading and do your other assignments or to go to bed?

I am sure you do.

You also enjoyed it too. Instead of sitting in front of a screen and watching seasons of a show, you would sit next to a window on a rainy day or out on your patio on a beautiful summer morning getting lost in the book. Mine's was Percy Jackson, what was yours?

Can you do that now? Maybe you can. But it might feel like a chore. That Netflix show might seem like the more attractive option. And there's nothing wrong with that. If you enjoy that more than by all means go ahead. But there's people out there who watch Netflix too, but long to go back to the days where they would be able to read a book and enjoy it and have that be their pasttime. Rather than watching TV.

So when did it all stop? Well you have to go back and look at your life. Think about when you stopped reading books and not just that, but other indoor or outdoor real life activities. For me, it's when I got introduced to #a-t-games{{video games}}. I could still manage, but I played more video games than anything. Everything was already crumbling and hanging in the balance until I got my first phone. That's when it all changed.

I would spend the majority of my time on the phone and when I wasn't I would be on video games. And vice versa. Books out the window. Going outside was out the window. #symp-worse-social-life{{I quit my sports team}} to be playing more video games and because #symp-less-motivation{{I generally became lazy}}.

Then #a-t-porn{{porn}} happened. That was really the knockout blow. I became addicted and developed all the problems you see other porn addicts have. #symp-anxiety{{Social anxiety}}, #symp-less-motivation{{low motivation}}, #symp-feel-bad{{feelings of purposelessness}} and the #symp-anhedonia{{inability to enjoy little things}}.

Life is made up of the little things, so once you lose the spark in that, how could you expect to be happy?

I could keep going on with my story but that would be a waste of time at this point. I told it to see if you could relate. Now let's get to the solution.

There is no life-hack. No youtube video. No reddit post (maybe this one lol). No breathing trick or 5 second rule that will change your life.

If we kept getting stung by hornets, we wouldn't focus on buying ointment and making salves, we would focus on **getting rid of the hornets.**

And we are going to get rid of the hornets.

People always say to do Nofap, to cut porn, to quit video games, etc. I completely agree with all of this. However, let's get to it at the source. **It's the screen.**

The phone and the screen is the enabler for all these things.

The screen can literally be equated to a magical portal. It's an illusion that captivates you and wastes time. Precious time of your life. Now you can use the screen to be productive, such as if you run an online business or use it to learn, but the majority of people spend less time doing that than they do being mindless drones.

Buy a dumb phone or turn your phone into one. Set restrictions on your computer. If you truly do this, you won't be able to waste time anymore. You won't have access to porn. You won't be able to play video games. You'll have your time back and your dopamine will be fixed to the point where you enjoy real life again.

Another benefit that is rarely talked about is the ability to think for yourself again and have no third party influencing your thoughts. You are alone with your thoughts and that's when your best ideas come. Nowadays, the only time we're alone with our thoughts is when we're about to sleep. And we fall asleep quickly anyways so that's not true time to your thoughts. When you truly spend time with your thoughts, that's when your life purpose gets revealed to you.

During the start of quarantine. I was doing all the bad stuff and #symp-worse-sleep{{staying up late until 6 am}}. Everyday. It was bad. I had enough and #tech-deactivate/delete-account{{deleted my xbox account}} and #tech-smart-dumbphone{{turned my phone into a dumbphone and threw the password away}}. My computer is a family computer and I can't spend much time on it anyway. Boy has my life changed.

I went from staying up late and waking up at 3 pm, #ben-better-sleep{{to waking up with the sun rise}}, #other-activities-walk{{going for walks with my dogs}}, #other-activities-exercise{{exercising}}, and #other-activities-read{{reading books.}} Just overall being #ben-productive{{productive}}.

**But wait....**

To you, or anyone else reading this, this might seem boring. Who cares if you're going on walks or reading books?

**Here's the kicker**

I enjoy it. #ben-appreciate-more{{I truly enjoy what I am doing}}. When I go for my walks I get this sense of joy and euphoria. When I listen to music #ben-feel-better{{I feel so good}}. More so than I ever had before. Everything is gold tinted to me. Simple tasks like doing my laundry feel satisfying. Learning is fun and reading books is starting to become easy and enjoyable. The thing is, I can't explain it. You have to experience the magical feeling of truly being alive. It's like someone who sky dived trying to explain to you the feeling you get. You could get a grasp of it but still wouldn't fully know it. And you get this by cutting out all the bad stuff.

#ben-less-anxiety{{My social anxiety is also gone}}. I read somewhere that social anxiety has strong ties to dopamine and the stuff that I'm doing is a "dopamine detox". Even though that most likely is not the correct scientific explanation, I can tell you first hand that this stuff changed my life. I have not felt like this since I was a kid and I am 21.

Also this is like an avalanche of good stuff. You "dopamine fast". You have #ben-more-time{{more time}}. You start getting sensitized to simple things. You #ben-productive{{enjoy those productive things more}}. Since you enjoy those thing you do them more often. So now not only are you doing it because you have no other option since you cut the bad stuff out but because you also enjoy it. You start to get happy because you finally see the fruits of your labor. You rinse and repeat.

If I could explain how I feel. It would be like putting on eye contacts after having jank vision your whole life. Emotional contacts I'd call it haha.

Theres WAY more that I can explain but this post is already too long and at that point it would look like im trying to sell you on a "dopamine detox" or something like that. Just do it for yourself, I PROMISE YOUR LIFE WILL CHANGE FOR THE BETTER!}}
