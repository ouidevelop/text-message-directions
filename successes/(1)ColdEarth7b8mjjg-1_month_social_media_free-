#post{{Made It! One month (4 weeks). It felt like a detox, i was able to read a lot more, #ben-better-connection{{it definitely improved my relationships}}, #ben-less-anxiety{{made me a lot calmer}} and i had lots of time to contemplate  my social media behaviour. #tech-time-limits{{I now set my self a time window of half an hour a day for social media}} use so i won't misuse it again. I'm new here, and this is my first post on this subreddit. So I'd really appreciate some more tips on how to engage with the internet and especially social media in a healthy way. My times almost up, so see you tomorrow I look forward to your suggestions. :) }}
