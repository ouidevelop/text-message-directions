#post{{I finally had enough and #tech-delete/deactivate-account{{deactivated}} my #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}} account after nearly 15 years of using social media (not just Facebook). Back in 2020, I had a purge of my social media and got rid of #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}} and #a-t-twitter{{Twitter}}, but kept Facebook because it was convenient. November last year, I finally had enough and deactivated Facebook (planning to eventually delete it once I finish a commission for someone, I use messenger to keep them updated)

I've noticed a huge difference with my concentration, #other-activities-read{{I get so much reading done these days}} which is amazing considering #symp-worse-concentration{{two years ago I could barely concentrate reading a page.}}

#withdrawal-loneliness{{What I wasn't prepared for was the loneliness.}} #bad-lose-contact{{My friends of nearly ten years barely speak to me now. My texts go unanswered and the group chat I was a part of has gone suddenly dead, so I think they've moved to a different group chat or kicked me out}}. No one has really noticed that I deactivated and it's made me feel as if I didn't really matter or that the friendships I thought I had with people didn't really exist.

In any case, it's still the best thing I've done and I can't wait to finally delete it and be free finally!}}
