#post{{Long post ahead and no TL;DR so please stop reading if you're not in the mood.

I've been addicted to social media since they first appeared. My preferred ones changed but I've been addicted mostly to #a-t-twitter{{Twitter}} and #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}}, both of them I spent hours every day just scrolling with no end in sight.

I knew that had to stop, so back in May last year I decided to stop cold turkey. I know #tech-misc{{willpower isn't the best tool in this situation but I have to say, it worked}}. I didn't scroll Reddit yet since I left and I only visited Twitter if I needed something specific that I could check in a few minutes. So I consider that a win.

I didn't quite left reddit cold turkey since I wanted to check the posts on this sub (I unsubbed later but whatever). Right now I visit reddit daily but #tech-unsubscribe{{unsubbed literally every sub I was part of except 6, all of them are from niche games and manga that barely get a post a week}}, so everytime I come here I don't last more than 5 minutes.

My point is: Cold turkey is definitely better than spending hours and hours scrolling twitter, #a-t-tiktok{{tiktok}}... But I don't think it's something worth it long term.

I've been reading the book #book-smart-phone-dumb-phone{{''smart phone dumb phone''}} which has been recommended on this sub countless times and you probably know already. It has some good points but I also disagree with some others (treating all videogames the same when the only dangerous ones are the f2p competitive endless type that cause addiction but whatever). I didn't reach the end yet but so far the authors are saying that they intend to get rid of internet addiction with logic, and not willpower.

So, using that same argument: Isn't it okay to use social media from time to time to check news on stuff you like? I'm not even talking about FOMO. But seriously, I've missed news and stuff I really wanted to know but never did or did too late because I left social media.

I'm happy with my internet usage right now. I use reddit daily, yes, but never more than a few minutes a day. And I don't consider myself a failure. Sometimes I use it a bit more if I want to read something specific. If I'm a part of a big fandom, instead of being subbed to their subreddit because it'll probably have a lot of posts (and therefore scrolling begins), I just check their best monthly or weekly posts. If I missed something important I'll just find out doing that, no need to scroll through a lot of worthless posts I couldn't care less about.

About some others like Facebook and Twitter... I think there's nothing wrong with using it but #tech-unsubscribe{{just reducing the amount of friends}}. This was mentioned too in the book. Using Facebook as a digital photo album isn't THAT bad, and using Facebook to stay connected to close family and friends is okay as well. And by that I mean no more than 50 friends/followers.

In Twitter, I went from 300 followed people to 30. I'll probably reduce it more if I think a certain someone is posting way too much. Disabling retweets maybe. But there are people I actually care about and reading about them from time to time shouldn't be considered bad. I'll try this for about a week and if it's getting out of control I'll go back to cold turkey.

As I said. It's better NO social media than being addicted. But specific and short usage of social media should be okay. I don't know if this is an unpopular opinion. If you have no self control and you think using just a bit of it can escalate then don't. I'm doing this because my addiction is in control now and I want to know if I'm more satisfied with a bit of social media usage or with no social media at all.

I want to know your opinions as well. Do you think using social media from time to time within a small social circle is okay?

P.S: Oh and by the way, I was a fool for believing overcoming my addiction would make me happy. I'm still depressed. Send help.

Edit: I also forgot to mention I uninstalled all social media from my phone and only use it on my phone and that was the best thing I could've done. I even went on a vacation with no social media, that was quite an experience and hope you do it as well.}}
