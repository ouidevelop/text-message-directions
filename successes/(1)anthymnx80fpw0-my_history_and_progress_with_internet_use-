#post{{Since some people like to see some progress/success/story posts, I thought I could share where I'm at and maybe people recognize themselves in parts or get motivated. I'm trying to keep it as short as possible, (though desktop always looks shorter I guess, but I'm giving you bullet points!). 

So, I'm 22 years old and got my very own computer at 12 years old, which basically marks 10 years of unlimited desktop internet access now. We only got home internet when I was 9 years old and I didn't have a phone with a colorful screen, games, internet and a camera until I was about 15, so you could say I'm still part of the people that had a life outside of constant access to the internet. 

Getting my own computer basically perfectly lined up with my parents' divorce, our home situation getting even worse, and usual puberty stuff and stressful school things starting. So the internet was a perfect distraction to the awful things happening to me outside of it, and a way to vent to people who could understand. I soon spent basically all of my freetime on it. I had the luxury of making my first social media experiences in a closed network for students that was very private instead of having all of my embarassing mistakes plastered over Facebook, but the internet still harmed me. I would say I was only moderately addicted, since I didn't feel any true withdrawals, it was just something I did; and when I was at places where there was no internet, I didn't mind at all.. I kind of embraced it even. But it still did some damage.

Some of the damage is widely discussed here, but some of it is more niche or less known.

For example:

* #symp-not-doing-interests{{I stopped reading books almost completely, even though I used to love it}}. #symp-worse-concentration{{My attention span got worse}}, and I got #symp-anxiety{{nervous}}, #symp-bored{{easily bored}} etc. #symp-worse-concentration{{I only skipped over articles even though I was interested in the topic, and couldn't just watch a movie.}} My brain was so used to all kinds of stimulation that watching a movie was only possible while scrolling a feed, so weird.
* #symp-anxiety{{I was getting obsessed with the internet and what people could post in real time about me that I possibly missed, so I was always anxious about it.}}
* The people who are now smartphone addicts were people bullying me for always being online back then, ironically. 
* My #symp-worse-social-skills{{social skills suffered}} because I could only express myself well in writing and #symp-worse-school{{basically didn't go outside except for school, later I even skipped that too.}}
* Because I used the internet to vent about my bad home situation (nowadays I'm diagnosed with PTSD from it), I was easily #symp-misc{{taken advantage of by predators online}} through guilt tripping, emotional blackmailing, etc. and was traumatized additionally. It's easy for bad people online to abuse young, traumatized children or teens looking for some adult that validates them and their experience at home. That includes soliciting nudes of minors under the guise of "But I always listen to you, can't you do this one thing for me? If you don't do it I will stop talking to you!" and for vulnerable young people online, a source of trust falling away seems so much worse than it is. In short, the internet ca be harmful for vulnerable people because they can be further victimized or even recruited for questionable stuff.
* Later on, I was obsessed with having as many accounts as possible because I loved filling in everything about myself and uploading things; I also thought it would be great to basically follow every little thing I even mildly liked "just to be sure" and "it can't harm!". That meant lots of accounts at lots of websites, just scrolling through feeds endlessly. When I finished one feed about 2 hours later or so, another waited, and the cycle began. Since it took me so long to check one, the others basically renewed. It was endless. I was #symp-wasted-time{{wasting a lot of time}}. #symp-wasted-time{{Time I didn't spend on proper hobbies, educating myself, studying, working on myself}}, .. I had to do all that starting later on.
* The influence of all those accounts and everyone I had been following had a #symp-feel-bad{{very negative effect on my depression}} and made it a lot worse. #symp-feel-bad{{I was often crying and feeling hopeless about life}} because #symp-comparing{{I thought mine was so shitty and could never possibly be as great as the ones I saw}}. I thought they probably never had to deal with things I had to deal with, and so therefore my life must be permanently sullied and I should just give up. Even just seeing a nice image of something on #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}} in a bad episode could really make me #symp-suicidality{{suicidal}}.
* I #symp-worse-sleep{{lost a tremendous amount of sleep}}. I also only could fall asleep to the sounds of Let's Plays running in the background.
* #symp-obsessive-thoughts{{My thoughts were also constantly racing and I couldn't shut them off at night}}. Later on, I even developed stress-induced voices that I hear in my head, especially when it's quiet and I'm trying to fall asleep. In really bad times with lots of internet use, they were basically screaming in my head.
* The internet made me #symp-lonely{{lonely}} by keeping me hooked to it, but I was also hooked to it because of loneliness. I couldn't reach out to people well, so reading strangers' posts or chatting online was easier but not a good alternative longterm, in retrospect.
* Later on, my thoughts were very focused on being funny, relatable, getting recognition and validation from notes/likes etc. and my thoughts weren't normal.. they were about how I could frame something I just saw or did as cool, sarcastic, trendy, meme-y.. once I really realized that, I was so shocked that my first thought was how I could post something to be more liked or come off as a cooler person, than thinking about telling someone in real life about it in a completely normal way. 
* #symp-living-for-online{{When I went shopping, it wasn't about if I needed this product or not, or if it was useful or not - I was thinking about how cool it would look on my instagram page}}, or how I could take a photo of it and what filter I would use so it would look good. #symp-living-for-online{{Literally anything I saw wasn't for me, but for this internet persona I was subconsciously trying to create}}, because I was trying to impress people. It was ridiculous.
* It #symp-misc{{made my executive dysfunction worse. I just couldn't get up, couldn't do things, even things I enjoyed, things I desperately wanted to do.}} That's what made stopping internet consumption so awful for me: #withdrawal-difficult-thoughts-and-feelings{{Putting the phone down would mean confronting those bad feelings of guilt, anxiety, unproductivity, and feeling almost paralyzed}}. I didn't want to confront those feelings of yelling at myself inside my head to finally get up, but I physically couldn't, not even to treat myself to something I enjoyed.


So in short, I cleaned up my act starting around 1 1/2 years ago, more intensely starting mid of 2017. I did so because of realizing a lot (at first not all) of this, and also because #symp-worse-concentration{{I couldn't sit through a 20 minute episode of a TV show without getting bored and wanting to scroll on my phone.}}

#tech-deactivate/delete-account{{My social media accounts are down to two}} (this one here included). #tech-unsubscribe{{Who and what I follow was drastically reduced from hundreds, to basically 30 people barely posting}}, and #tech-unsubscribe{{13 subreddits}}. I reduced what and when I post drastically too, rather opting to tell people directly. That really improved my communication with people, because instead of expecting them to see it on the feed, I could send them the thing directly and talk to them about it. I'm done with all feeds in the matter of 10-15 minutes in the morning (8am) and then I don't need to check again until the evening because there's nothing new waiting for me. Knowing there's nothing new, I am forced to do something else. My goal isn't to stop internet use altogether or get a dumbphone, as a sidenote, but use the internet consciously and healthily, and I feel like I'm on a good path right now.

These weren't the only benefits. now to the rest of them, or the healing, so to say:

* Less checking and scrolling means #ben-more-time{{more time}} available obviously. Things I thought I didn't have any time for suddenly fit my day. It was just a matter of taking control, and setting priorities. I'm trying to make it so I don't say "I don't have time for this" but acknowledging I could make time for it if I made it a priority. This puts the responsibility on me, instead of an unknown power just stealing my time.
* I was finally able to #ben-productive{{get things done}}, #ben-more-self-esteem{{feel proud of myself}}, feel like I had a little #ben-more-intentional/controlled{{more control over my life}}, which is good for depression.
* Cleaning up the feeds, my devices etc. made everything easy to find and I know where everything is stored and it's easily accessible. Digital minimalism doesn't only get rid of distractions, but also saves you time and worries.#ben-more-intentional/controlled{{Things feel lighter and more in your control}}.
* #ben-less-anxiety{{My anxiety got way less}} because less posting means less possible offense or fights, same with profiles. Disengaging from a lot of things online lead to more calmer areas of discussion that had much less potential to be explosive, so there wasn't this cloud hanging over me anymore that people are gonna tear me to shreds when I'm not looking (and being offline).
* Not having the internet as distraction really forces you to take a look at yourself and your life, #ben-self-improvement{{cultivate yourself}}, do some selfcare, improve in some ways, finally build up some boundaries and really take yourself seriously, at least in my case. #ben-more-intentional/controlled{{I am much more solid in who I am, what my values are, what I need to take care of, what I want for the future, what I need to defend myself against, etc}}. This makes me more prepared to withstand abuse, even online.
* #ben-less-comparing{{I haven't been crying about comparing my living situation to others for a long time now}}, and #ben-feel-better{{I actually feel pretty okay or even good about my life}}. Instead of condemning my life, I got the strength to change a lot about it and myself.
* #ben-better-sleep{{I sleep much better}}, my #ben-clear-thoughts{{thoughts are much more clear and focused}}, and I can usually control them and the 'noise'. The voices in my head disappear in good times, and are pretty quiet in bad times. That wasn't only the internet reduction, but meditation too.
* While #ben-less-consumption{{the consumption mindset changed early and fast}} and #ben-stopped-living-for-the-internet{{I stopped thinking in terms of pictures I could take of products}}, I was struggling for a month with not framing my thoughts as a nonchalant, meme-y, funny tumblr post. Admitting that is so weird. But hey, it's not happening anymore. Not having certain accounts, unfollowing certain people and going through that phase of breaking the habit works. I picked up my phone lots of times just to realize I don't own the account anymore to make that sarcastic short remark before it changed, though.
* Less exposure to others' lifestyle, product placements, ads, social media influencers etc. also means less useless consumption and #ben-saved-money{{saving money.}}
* #other-activities-read{{Books are fun again and I am basically reading every day now, the other day even multiple hours consecutively}}. #ben-better-attention{{I can also read longer articles online again, I have more patience, my attention span is back.}}
* Unusual sideffect, but reducing internet consumption also cut my gaming consumption. Reducing internet time and who I follow reduces me seeing game stuff, wanting to keep up and have/play the newest thing to be able to talk about it or not get spoilered etc. and I stopped thinking about how cool having played this game would make me seem, but what I actually wanted to play and had the time to play. It made me cut out games unhealthy for me as well. Cutting the internet and realizing the damage it did to me just made me realize the same in excessive gaming as well, so it was convenient and basically happened effortlessly on the side. So now I'm only playing 2 games occasionally.

Maybe this will motivate some people or you're just curious how others manage their journey. I'm still on it, because I'm still in the unhealthy home situation and still kinda lonely at times which can reinforce the internet use for me, but it's going alright. If I can remove myself from the unhealthy situation soon and also get the opportunity to meet new people at new job opportunities, it'll get a lot better even.}}
