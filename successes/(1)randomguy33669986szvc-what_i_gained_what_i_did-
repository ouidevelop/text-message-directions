This is what I did in 2017.  

As on 1st September 2017, I stopped using #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}}. It’s been more than 6 months now, and I have no problem. I’m not missing out on any important things and saving a lot of time by not using it.

As on 1st October 2017, I stopped using #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}}. Almost 6 months now. I was addicted to Instagram, due to which I spent almost close to 3 hours occasionally a day on Instagram. Now that I’m off of it, #ben-less-anxiety{{I feel relieved}}, and #ben-more-time{{I’m saving a lot of time}}. #ben-misc{{Quitting Instagram cut off my ties with a lot of unwanted people}}. #symp-comparing{{Watching others spend their luxurious life was downer for me}}. #ben-less-comparing{{It helped me a lot in thinking only about myself and what I need to do instead of thinking about how others are enjoying life.}}

As on 15th December 2017, I stopped watching TV shows. I used to binge watch #a-t-tv-and-movies{{Netflix}} shows for like 8 hours a day once in a while and minimum of 3 hours on all days. Quitting was hard, but I know it had to be done.

When I looked back on my movie watching habits, I realised that I haven’t seen any movies after January 2017. So not watching movies wasn’t a problem for me. Occasionally I feel like watching a movie, based on the trailer that I saw on YouTube, but it’s easy to skip that. 

#tech-unsubscribe{{I unsubscribed from all of the time wasting channels on #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}}}}. Only subbed to good and productive ones which will help me.

This is what I did in 2017 to increase my productivity and I can happily tell you that I got good results. 

I used the available time for ;
1.	#other-activities-read{{Reading books ( I was never a reader, started as a replacement to browsing )}}
2.	#other-activities-exercise{{exercise}}
3.	#ben-better-sleep{{better sleep at nights}}
4.	#other-activities-learn{{more time to study}}
5.	#other-activities-socializing{{more time with family}}

I can assure you one thing, wasting time on social media is killer. It’s like a drug. You should stop it or reduce it to bear minimum. }}
