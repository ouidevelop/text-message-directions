#post{{Before I begin, I want to address something I've seen in this community on posts that I don't think is helpful. That is projection. Nosurf doesn't have clear cut rules the way nofap or semen retention do in terms of "the right way to do it". For some people, nosurf means deleting all your accounts online and buying a "dumb phone", which is great. For others, it means keeping everything and setting time limits for apps, and that's great too. What isn't great is arguing with people who are making progress and improving themselves because their idea of nosurf isn't the same as your idea of it. I can guarantee there will be people who disagree with my intentions and methods. That's fine. Projecting on me isn't going to convince me of much. I can think for myself. And to anyone who asks, yes I've seen the Social Dilemma. It was a great doc, but I was honestly not surprised by anything I saw in the film.

 For myself, #tech-delete{{I only deactivated #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}} and #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}}}}. Other social apps I use are reddit which I follow 18 communities (10 are career related, 4 are faith based, 3 are related to nofap and then the other is this one), LinkedIn which I use for job searching and networking, and YouTube which I use for educational and self development content. Combined reddit and YouTube I spend about half an hour a day on and might spend half an hour to an hour on LinkedIn because I'm job hunting right now. I plan on bringing Facebook and Instagram back eventually. My goal with the current indefinite deactivation is to change my relationship to them, which before was more problematic. If I find problems arise again, I'll simply deactivate them again. I feel gross if I know I'm wasting time online (or wasting time period. I'm ENTJ), and #symp-wasted-time{{I would waste the most time online between Facebook and Instagram}} (and twitter when I had it years ago). So here's what I've noticed being free of FB and IG and just generally being mindful of nosurf, in no particular order:

1. I can leave my phone at home and #ben-less-anxiety{{leave my house for hours without anxiety over missing texts or notifications}}. #ben-freedom{{I'm no longer a slave to my phone}}
2. #ben-energy{{I have more energy}}
3. #ben-productive{{Productivity has increased quite a bit.}} #ben-more-time{{I've had more time}} to #other-activities-read{{read books}}, #other-activities-productivity{{apply for jobs}}, #other-activities-exercise{{work out}}, #other-activities-productivity{{take care of errands}} and #other-activities-learn{{self educate}}
4. #ben-less-anxiety{{Anxiety period has been reduced.}} #ben-less-comparing{{Since I'm not seeing constantly people with "better lives" than me I don't worry about being single or jobless as much}}
5. #ben-feel-better{{I'm generally much happier and less irritable. There's way more joy to living life.}}
6. #ben-better-social-life{{I pursue genuine connections with my friends more ie texting them and going for coffee or beers with them instead of just "liking" a photo they post}}
7. For those on nofap, temptation is greatly reduced (I didn't follow IG models nor did my explore page have any. I'm talking about girls I know posting "hot pics")
8. #ben-more-intentional/controlled{{I find myself more introspective to my ideas and goals in life, and structure my day to pursue those life goals (going to the gym, eating healthy, reading, applying for jobs, doing a software tutorial etc)}}
9. #ben-less-anxiety{{Interacting with others is much easier. Again to the anxiety thing.}}
10. #ben-less-fomo{{Fear of missing out (fomo) is gone. If there's a Facebook event that I can't get invited to, I know that if it's important enough someone will let me know. Otherwise I would not stress about missing it}}
11. #ben-more-confident{{Confidence is way higher. This is actually probably one of the biggest points}}

I know there are many more I can't think of right now, but the overall effects are similar to nofap, and that's because the big dopamine hits one gets on these apps aren't happening anymore. Your brain is more conditioned to reality and real rewards.}}
