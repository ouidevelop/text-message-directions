#post{{For over a year, I've been living #tech-no-home-internet{{without internet in my home. No cable either.}}

&amp;#x200B;

This has brought many lessons, and I'd love to share with you what setting aside your home as a "safe space" from the addictive internet has taught me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do note that the lack of internet is not due to financial limitations, but a choice I made when I first moved into my apartment. When I moved in and found that internet was not set up and that I would have to make arrangements myself I said screw it, let's just leave it be and see where this goes. 

&amp;#x200B;

**When I'm home, I'm home**

It can be really hard sitting at home with only your phone, and with the knowledge that your phones plan only supports #tech-limited-data{{2gb of data per month}}, you're not going to be surfing youtube anytime soon.

Not that I personally could, my phones data is not very fast. 

So instead, I was tragically forced to do something that I had almost forgotten how to do: #other-activities-think{{sit there and think.}}

When you take away the internet, one of the fuel sources behind the screen, you start to realize how much of your life it really consumes. 

I found myself prioritizing #other-activities-journal{{journaling}} and #other-activities-read{{reading a lot more}}. Next thing I knew the excuse #ben-more-time{{"I don't have time" simply dropped from my vocabulary}}. Turns out you have all the time in the world, the screens however will find their way into time that you don't fill.

#ben-contemplation{{And thinking! Taking time to think! Our brains need time to process and make decisions, and downtime is the time to do that.}} #symp-less-reflection{{However in contrast to my life previously every spare moment was spent on a screen, which deluded my brains ability to process my life.}}

Needless to say, life became a lot more certain.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pornographic Addiction Plummeted**

When you don't have internet, you can't exactly look at porn.

I didn't realize how much of an issue it really was until I was without it, and after those first, #withdrawal-misc{{really difficult weeks of being without [[porn]] I started to experience the benefits of dropping it.}}

At the time I was reading up on male spirituality ( not connected with religion ), read a couple of books but I found the best one on the subject was #book{{"The Wild Mans Journey".}} Reading it really gives you an understanding of what being male really is, and maybe, just maybe, feelings that you feel and who your are is a natural, powerful force, and nothing to feel ashamed of.

#ben-more-confident{{I developed much more confidence}}, both in my business and in my personal life. I gained the ability to #ben-more-assertive{{look my father in the eye and tell him he was wrong about something in a respectful way}}, and guide him towards a more reasonable way of thinking. #ben-gained-respect{{He respects me more now}}, and in turn I actually respect him a lot more too.

#ben-better-social-life{{It wasn't a month after quitting porn that I've gotten into the most stable, fulfilling relationship I've ever had with a woman.}}

&amp;#x200B;

**People suddenly became much more important**

I think back to when I was a kid playing #a-t-games{{video games}}, and how frustrated I would get if someone interfered with my game time. Whether it was my parents or my sisters.

After much reflection over my progress, I was able to piece together what the screen was to me, and the need it seemed to have filled, but in truth only made worse. 

In my teen years, I played a lot of RPGs, including final fantasy and harvest moon. I really enjoyed, and got attached to, the dating aspects of these rpgs. I would specifically keep in my party characters I were emotionally attached to because trying to do it for real was too difficult. 

#symp-worse-social-skills{{This carried on for years, and it wasn't until my very financial survival depended on going out there and figuring out how to talk to people that I started to realize how much I was really missing.}}

#ben-better-social-life{{I started to actually take time to connect with my parents, and we've since then established a really good relationship, far better than what I had with them growing up.}}

I'm actually able to have a conversation with my siblings without worry of hatred or disgust rooted from when we were kids overcoming me, causing me to openly shun them. 

I've learned that true value comes from bringing value to people, and it get's reciprocated by people who truly matter. 

#book{{Mathew Lieberman's book "Social"}} is what really pushed me in this direction. It's key to understand that fundamentally we are a social species, and true social interaction is required for a healthy, confident personality.

&amp;#x200B;

**All in all, priorities improved**

When you're addicted to the screen, it seems like such a small thing to "play a game" or "surf youtube for a while", let's say an hour of your time.

#symp-wasted-time{{The truth is that one hour flushed is an hour not doing anything to truly make yourself happier}}. It's not happiness a screen brings, but pleasure.

I wish I remember which book I read on this subject where this came from, but understanding the difference is so important. 

I started to realize that I was spending time that brought me excessive pleasure in the moment, but meant nothing in the future. Instead, I started doing things that bring a little pleasure in the moment, but continue to bring pleasure for years to come. I'm still riding on things that I did and studied over a year ago.

In summary, these are my experiences and takeaways. If you have any doubts as to what this subreddit represents just refer here. I of course can't speak for what you'll experience if you drop your screentime, but it's likely things will be very uncomfortable at first because you will be forced to think much more deeply about your life.

I would like to also make clear that my primary source of income is I own a local web development company, and my business is based online and developing web-based apps. I made this work by simply #tech-no-home-internet{{going to cafes to work during the day and leaving work alone at night}}. }}
