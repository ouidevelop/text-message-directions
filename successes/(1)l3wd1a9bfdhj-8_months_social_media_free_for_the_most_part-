#post{{Last December #tech-deactivate/delete-account{{I deactivated my #a-t-facebook{{facebook}} and #a-t-instagram{{instagram}}}}, #tech-delete{{uninstalled snapchat}} and never looked back. there was a brief couple weeks around my birthday in May where I used facebook to organize my birthday party, but got rid of it again immediately after.
#ben-lost-weight{{I've lost 10 pounds}} (a big deal for someone 5'0), #ben-better-work{{scored an incredible job working at a doggy daycare}}, and #ben-better-sleep{{my sleep patterns have never been better.}}
This is all coming from someone who used to spend 4-5 hours a day mindlessly scrolling my newsfeed in bed, overcome with insecurities. Someone who fell asleep with their phone in their hands every night.
Shit, I even bought a watch to use for checking the time at work instead of using my phone! 
I'm sorry if this comes off as bragging, I moreso want it to serve as motivation; if you can get through the first month or two you will absolutely feel the positive effects drown out how much you miss your screens.}}
