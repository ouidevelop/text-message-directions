#post{{It has been 1 month since my #tech-dumbphone{{smartphone broke and I picked a dumb phone to get by}}. I always wanted to leave my smartphone, tried multiple times to use a dumb phone that was lying around at my house (this guy is 7-8 years old and still works), #tech-not-work{{tried apps on my phone to block my use of internet}}, etc.

Social media like #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}} and #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}} were easy to leave. #tech-obscure-password{{I just changed my password to random letters and numbers and logged out}}. I got used to it in a week or two. The issue was #a-t-reddit{{reddit}} and #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}}. I felt like I was learning something from them. Whenever I would have a question, crisis, etc I would come to reddit.

When I started using my current phone, there were periods of discomfort. For #withdrawal-time{{first two weeks}} I was #withdrawal-anxiety{{physically anxious}} and #withdrawal-sick{{ill}}. I would be having an #withdrawal-anxiety{{anxiety attack}} and I would try to figure out why im having one and the moment I would pick up my dad's smartphone and open browser, my anxiety would calm down. That's when I understood what and why it was happening. #bad-lose-contact{{My friends pestered me to get my phone fixed or get a new one fast because I "lost contact" with them.}} It was a mess. #withdrawal-misc{{I genuinely felt crazy for a while}}. I would start to second guess my decision to leave smartphone, I would think why am I doing this? It's so stupid. Not having a smart phone is a very bad decision, etc. But #tech-review-motivations{{I would remind myself of why chose to do this}}. Past days when I would be fed up of my internet use, #symp-tired{{drained}}, #symp-wasted-time{{not having space and time to actually think and do the things I want}}.

Now I think it was a really good decision. I am #ben-better-sleep{{sleeping much better and on fixed time}}, I can easily observe my routine and things I am doing right and things I need to change. #ben-more-intentional/controlled{{I am able to observe and change routine very easily now}}. It has only been one month and I can see the change in my mood. #ben-better-handling-negative-emotions{{I still get anxious (because of other reasons) but now I don't jump to internet to calm my anxiety. Now I sit with it or call my friends/family to talk about it.}} Somehow my #ben-better-social-life{{friendship with some people have improved over this time}}. People who care enough to reach via a call and not just chat, and people I care enough to call.

It's just a start and I think I will continue with my decision to not use a smartphone for the future. Maybe I will come back and update you guys on my journey. 

Till then take care you all. No matter what situation you are going through in life right now, you will end up fine, you will end up good.}}
