#post{{It's been a month since I deleted all my social media except for #a-t-youtube{{Youtube}} of course and guys let me tell you my experience has been awesome It's like a cheat code I feel Iike a kid again it's like im finally back in my own universe where im the main character in his evolution Arc I wish I did this a lot sooner with #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}} since that's the only social media I was hooked onto I wasn't really into Snapchat or Twitter and thankfully I deleted Facebook years ago.

Cons of me being on social media 
[Mindlessly scrolling, dumb celebrity gossip, #symp-worse-social-life{{arguing with friends just because you didn't like their recent photo}}, random group chat invitations, fake online validation or #symp-comparing{{being envious of others}}, #symp-feel-bad{{depression}}, #symp-wasted-time{{wasting valuable time}}, #symp-worse-sleep{{terrible sleep}}, etc]

Pros of me not being on social media 
[#ben-productive{{More productivity}}, #other-activities-learn{{learned a language}}, #other-activities-read{{finally finished a book in year's}}, #other-activities-exercise{{working out more}}, #ben-better-sleep{{better sleep quality}}, #ben-more-positive{{more positivity}}, more time for Anime, #ben-better-social-life{{connecting more with family}}, #ben-being-present{{observing my surroundings}} and the list goes on ]

Now I understand some people use Instagram for business and I guess connecting with others but I am so happy for this new chapter in my life and I hope you get a chance to try it too if anything try disabling your account for a week and see if you get any results please let me know your experiences after deleting social media and being free.
