#post{{So, 6 weeks ago, #tech-dumbphone{{I cut out my smartphone and switched to a dumb phone}}. I took the battery, stuck it in my student house, and stuck the body of the phone in my parent's house.

**What are the results?**

Now I am getting up at around 5am daily, #other-activities-contemplative{{meditating and praying for 2 hours in the morning}}, #other-activities-exercise{{lifting and swimming 6 times a week,}} and #ben-feel-better{{I have never felt better}}. #ben-productive{{I've got so much done}}. #ben-better-looks{{My body even looks substantially different even in these 3 weeks}} (largely down to the fact #ben-better-sleep{{my sleep is way way better quality}}).

**Why?**

I did this because I needed to crush some assignments at university. I am already sitting at pretty good grades, but I want to graduate with the best grade possible.

Also, after some prayers, It was revealed to me that I have some pretty serious vices (predominantly sloth and pride). So, I wanted to set these in order.

**How?**

#withdrawal-urges{{I grunted through the initial shock of being separated from something I was spending 3 1/2 hours a day on. This wasn't all that difficult (I fast weekly, so I was somewhat used to resisting temptations).}}

On top of that, #tech-track-time{{I installed timers to monitor my time on social media.}} I was spending in excess of 2 hours just scrolling through facebook, and more than I care to admit on YouTube. I managed to cut this out.

In the meantime, I reviewed my year on paper, and decided on some #tech-misc{{set goals}} (This was not a new year's resolution, I just noted some ideas on paper on around the 15th December). I've fulfilled these goals pretty quickly.

This was largely through the discovery of a book called #book{{The Little Office Of The Blessed Virgin Mary}}. This gave me a reason to get up early. So I started at 7:30am to pray, and moved back 10 minutes at a time, each day. I corresponded my prayer so I'd go to bed at the right time (\~10pm). I use these early mornings and nights as an opportunity for weeding out my imperfections through self reflection and meditation. St Bede states outright that the best time for meditations are the evening.

**Where Next?**

I plan on getting a ThinkPad and installing Linux to cut the internet problem, since I am still spending a lot of time online.  I also am going to fully fast from electronics on Fridays, with my current Windows "Fun" Laptop spending time in the draw on Wednesdays.

On top of this, I want to resharpen my skills in Latin and Web Development, so I am actively setting aside time to study this. These two skills are concentration based tasks, so by training this focus I will do a lot better.

Finally, I am currently having about 3-4 cups of coffee a day. So, I am going to start fasting from this on wednesdays and fridays.

**Some Advice**

\- Via Negativa really works. Just take the battery out, and go cold turkey.

\- Have something you want to replace it with, and just do it. 

\- #tech-journaling{{Journal}}. #tech-plan-time{{Actually note down what you want to do at each time of the day}}. Make this flexible and don't be a perfectionist. I spend around 20 minutes a day doing this a day. Always allow for time to be bored ( Not this weird state of contentment you are in mindlessly surfing).

\- It takes roughly 3 weeks to weed out a bad habit, and 3 weeks to place a good one in its place. This is why Lent is 40 days. Habits are also everything. So, pick a habit you want to remove and a good habit to replace it with, and resist and flee from the temptation (this includes being far away from the means of that temptation)

\- Cut out all modern music. Listen exclusively to audiobooks, chant and classical music. Plato says that music quite literally programs our means of thought (the time signatures of music even synchronise thought). From experience, he is extremely correct. Most modern music has such a structure as to alter the emotions (anybody who has been to a nightclub will tell you it can get you in the mood). So, listen to that sort of music which is designed to focus your reason.

**A Final Note**

Go and read #book{{The Ascent Of Mount Carmel Book I}} by St John Of The Cross. Read each chapter 3 times and think about it for 5 minutes before moving on. This is probably the most significant single book I have ever read (and I have around 350 on my goodreads).

Internalise that you will never be happy until your attachments are subordinated to reason. Only through subordinating these can you pursue what you truly want, and therefore obtain true freedom.}}
