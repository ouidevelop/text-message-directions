#post{{ #tech-deactivate/delete-account{{The only accounts I still have are}} #a-t-reddit{{reddit}} (duh), #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}}, my WordPress art blog, #a-t-forums{{The Long Hair Community forum}}, and #a-t-forums{{Wet Canvas forum}}.

I've been avoiding reddit like the plague, the evidence is in my post history. I only keep this account because there comes times when the only place I can ask a question is here, sometimes google just doesn't cut it. 

I see some social media posts over my partner's shoulder and it reminds me why I don't participate anymore. Luckily she's just a lurker, I think it'd be harder if she was super into posting and stuff. 

I watched a LOT more YouTube after we got a smart TV but that's dwindled down to basically nothing. A few videos every few days, and now most of what I watch is with my partner so it's a social activity rather than escapism. 

I post a lot more on my art blog, which is a good thing. I love WordPress because it's so much slower than a lot of other sites. Likes and comments are seldom because even for blogs with a lot of readers, many of those readers do not have WP accounts. This takes the number obsession stress off of me! I just put my stuff out there for the people who find it and happen to jive with it, and it makes me happy to make those real connections rather than worrying about appealing to the masses.

And TLHC... well I recently shaved my head again lol. I still pop in every now and again to check up on everybody but that's all. I still go there because in my experience it's one of the only online communities where everyone feels like real people... if that makes sense? My friends there feel like genuine friends, they notice when I'm gone, they message me to check in. It's nice. When I left #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}} years ago, nobody cared. Same with #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}} in 2020 and #a-t-twitter{{Twitter}} last year.

Wet Canvas... I forgot existed until I started writing this lol. 

#tech-do-other-things{{I think it helps that I have a 5 month old daughter, 3 cats, and my partner. I'm so busy with these real connections in real life that I have less time to waste scrolling}}! The daughter especially, I did previously neglect my IRL connections for scrolling/posting/dumb shit before she came into the picture, but now that she's here I focus on the present so much more. I refuse to neglect her, I want her childhood to be SO much happier than mine was.

I have been attending NA zoom meetings, because I am a recovering addict and that's what personally works for me (YMMV), but that feels the closest thing to in-person connections I have ever gotten through the internet. It makes me so grateful for technology, because I don't know what I'd do with myself otherwise. #ben-helps-with-narcotic-addiction{{And yes, being on the internet less has helped me a lot in my recovery from that too.}}

I still google stuff for information, read news articles here and there (I have to limit my news exposure though because of my extreme anxiety), and do some other basic utilitarian internet stuff. I still have a smart phone. It's handy for taking photos and videos, especially now that we have a baby who's growing up way too fast.

I've been #other-activities{{reading a LOT more}}, I've fallen back in love with books and I couldn't be happier! #other-activities{{I play video games too because they're currently not a problem for me (they have occasionally been in the past) but never MMOs only single player or local multiplayer.}} #other-activities{{I make art.}} #other-activities{{I play with my daughter.}} #other-activities{{I play with my cats.}} #other-activities{{I hang out with my partner.}} #other-activities{{We play card games.}} We do partner things. #other-activities{{We go on drives.}} #other-activities{{We go on walks. }}

I live life. Now go do the same. Log out of reddit for a while, no seriously, it'll still be here when you get back. I'll come see if anyone's replied in anywhere from a few days to a few months. Bye!}}
