#post{{Hi guys, I wanted to share a method I’ve found that has helped me significantly reduce the time I spend on my phone. Essentially it is based on recognizing that **#tech-not-work{{willpower}} alone is not enough** because smartphones are too addictive, and that **removing triggers will go a long way** toward reducing screen time.

**Here’s a list of what I do (no fluff, all actionable):**

**1. #tech-other-time-checking{{Wear a watch}}:** so that I can check the time without having to pull out my phone, which could lead me to checking messages/emails etc. and I end up being sucked into using my phone.

**2. #tech-stop-notifications{{Turn off all notifications}} (except WhatsApp and Telegram):** every time I receive a notification, there is a chance I’ll get sucked into mindlessly reading/checking things on my phone. By reducing the number of notifications, I’m basically reducing the number of “triggers” that can lead me down that path.

**2a. Why I use both WhatsApp and Telegram:** because my workplace has set up an office WhatsApp group. I want to be able to contact my friends and family on Telegram without having to open up WhatsApp. This is a personal choice.

**2b. Since I’ve turned off all notifications even for emails,** I’ll check my emails once in the morning, once in the afternoon and again in the evening -- instead of every time an email comes in.

**3. #tech-delete{{Deleting apps that are too addictive}}:** I used to spend a lot of time online playing chess and reading about chess, solving chess tactics/puzzles etc. It’s addictive and I’ve deleted a chess app I used to have.

**4. Stop going to websites that are heavy on clickbait:** I like reading the news, but some websites bait you into clicking on the next article and the next etc etc and can be a giant time suck. Once I notice a particular website is like this I just stop going to it. I don’t find this difficult to do; I just get my news elsewhere.

**5. #tech-misc{{Using a phone bag}} (this ties everything together):** I put my phone in a special bag (I’ll call it a “phone bag”). This is a great way to stop mindless reading/checking on the phone. Here are concrete examples of how it has helped me.

**Example 1:** I’m waiting for the bus or train and out of habit I pull out my phone “just to check something.” With a phone bag covering my phone, I’m reminded that I don’t really need to check something. I’ll then put the phone back in my pocket and that’s the first step to breaking the cycle of smartphone addiction.

**Example 2:** I get on the bus or train and again, out of habit, I pull out my phone just to “check something.” Again I’m reminded that I don’t really need to do so, and instead I put my phone away. This definitely has helped me break the cycle of smartphone dependence. It’s also helped me become **aware** of when I want to check something on my phone just out of habit.

**Summary:** So when I’m out and about, I always have my phone in a phone bag. I’ll only feel my phone vibrate when I have calls or WhatsApp/Telegram messages since all notifications are turned off. I’ve deleted addictive apps and have told myself which websites not to go on because they’re full of clickbait. Whenever I feel like taking my phone out just to check something, my phone is in a phone bag and I’m reminded I don’t really need to go on it. 

I hope you guys will find this helpful and I’d love to hear your comments/feedback. This set-up has definitely helped me. I’ve created a website (www.theunplugger.com) that offers phone bags, but a simple drawstring pouch or something similar will suffice.

Happy unplugging!
Andrew
