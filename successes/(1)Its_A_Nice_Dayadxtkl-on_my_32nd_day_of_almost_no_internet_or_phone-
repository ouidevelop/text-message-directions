#post{{#tech-rehab{{Been in a substance recovery facility with no computers, and very highly restricted phone access.}}

It feels like my brain is re-wiring itself.  

#ben-less-anxiety{{Been feeling a lot calmer}}. #ben-mentally-stable{{More in control of my moods and emotions}}. #ben-appreciate-more{{Able to enjoy less stimulating activities}} like #other-activities-socializing{{socializing}}, #other-activities-misc{{eating}}, and #other-activities-exercise{{working out far more.}}

Been #other-activities-contemplative{{meditating and doing a form of concentrated **intentional** physical activity every day}}, and it's #ben-clear-mind{{been far easier to focus on it without endless mental chatter, distraction, and impulsivity.}}

I got a wrist watch, and its crazy how much we get sucked into our phones just to check the time.  

#ben-more-patient{{A lot more patient too.  }}

#withdrawal-irritable{{I've been pretty irritable though}}, but theres a lot of other factors involved in my recovery than just too much pc/internet use.

#ben-better-social-life{{My social drive is a lot higher, too. It's greater than ever. Been talking to more people, holding conversations far better, able to pay attention and listen a lot better, and I just in general feel a stronger presence, a brighter aura, when im with people.}}

I've been in an environment where I'm constantly around people, which helps tremendously whenever there's the urge to isolate and escape when emotions get tough, or when i feel bored or understimulated.  

It also helped to be around people who I can relate to that understand my struggle.  

The facility I'm at is also all men. Tougher men who've been through a lot of shit. Many residents are fresh out of prison, or off the streets, so I've been able to express what I been through, and how I feel when high emotions come out, without them being all soft and bitchmade and arrogant like a lot of people online are.   

I feel like internet use causes us to generalize far more, reduce our empathy, be less compassionate, judge more discriminatory, and be much quicker to express negative emotions like anger.   

The fact I was able to be angry, yell, and act out, yet get a **SUPPORTIVE** response from people willing to **HELP** me, rather than being around soft people that are highly reactive and have vindictive personalities, really has helped me improve.  Being somewhere that highly emotional outbursts were ineffective, yet understood by my peers, taught me to practice more productive behavior. 

Maybe this isn't all internet related, but I had a bad "addiction cocktail"  where id stay in a cycle of 
internet-drugs-porn-games-junkfood-repeat;  all day, for years and years, and it really declined my mental and physical health. 

I got tired of people saying condescending shit to me about problems they dont relate to. And those who try to dismiss the problems because they're defensive about something they enjoy. They just don't understand and won't understand.  

I realized I needed to be somewhere that I was completely unable to access my addictions and compulsions, and made the decision to go into treatment. 

Another great benefit, too, is not constantly polluting my mind with the endless toxicity of the internet. I believe too much of this has a negative impact on our mental health and overall outlook on life. Today, I'm able to focus on whats important to my life, here, and now.   

I look forward to the road ahead.
