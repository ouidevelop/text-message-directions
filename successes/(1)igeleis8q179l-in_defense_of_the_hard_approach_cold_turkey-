#post{{A lot of posts in this subreddit deal with the question of how to partially limit ones time spent online at home. I think that's the wrong way to tackle this in *every* case if you are addicted to the Internet (which is very likely the case if you are reading, or even posting in this subreddit) The problem is never that we do not know what the right thing to do would be (i.e. to limit our exposure to the Internet only for things that are absolutely necessary) but that we finIn defense of the hard approach ("cold turkey") ways to legitimise leaving a small escape route in our nosurf "plan". Although I know this sounds like armchair psychology, I am pretty sure that in most cases this is just your subconsciousness trying to undermine any attempts to actually do something about your addiction. Why do I know this? Because I have been there myself, about one year ago. The only thing that has helped me to finally overcome my addiction was taking the hard route by making it impossible for me to go online at home (without actually cancelling my contract, but I'll get to that later)

I was always keen on learning more about programming, privacy and crypto-related topics and I never used any social media websites or any smartphone messengers. However I began to notice about one year ago that I never manage to go deeper into topics I found interesting while I was connected to the Internet. First I tried to increase my ability to concentrate and pay attention to only one program/text by simply not runnning more than one, but that quickly turned out to be ineffective and after maybe 10 minutes I would end up with 5 tabs and 3 programs open again. Then I became more interested in terminal/cli applications on linux, which are naturally more effective and less distracting (e.g. text browsers in the terminal). I familiarised myself with tmux (a terminal multiplexer) and for a while I used only that and no GUI at all. It was a good learning experience linux-wise, but still I ended up checking my mail all the time, browsing superficially instead of reading deeply online, just that I was doing it on a white-on-black virtual console now. So that experiment failed.

On a positive note, around that time I #tech-dumbphone{{sold my smartphone}}, which I mostly just used for listening to podcasts while walking/doing chores/commuting. I got myself a used dumb phone for less than 5 euros and bought a good old walkman (a relatively new model actually, which was expensive but definitely worth the price -  I am using it for at least two hours every day to listen to talks, podcasts etc. while doing sports now, with bluetooth earbugs). All in all, this at least eliminated my ability to go online while I am not at home unless I would carry my netbook, which I hardly ever did at that time.

To come back to the nosurf problem: I began to immerse myself into some anti-tech reading, nothing too extreme actually but texts (also nosurf threads) in which people wrote about their negative experiences with computer/smartphone/Internet addiction. At that time, I was convinced of the negative consequences of being online for many hours a day or checking my mail every half an hour and thereby disrupting other activities, but despite all the theoretical knowledge on the bad side of things, it did not really occur to me that not going online at home AT ALL is realistic or feasible. What eventually made me realise that it can actually be done and is not a totally absurd idea was a video in which one guy (who is actually not a Luddite but really good at tech/Linux-related stuff) talked about how he did (voluntarily) not have Internet at home for two years because of the bad effects it has on people. That gave me the final push to try it myself.

I cannot get rid of my Internet connection at home entirely as my boyfriend (who is not addicted) needs the connection from time to time, so there's that. Of course, at first I tried the usual things that many of you probably tried as well: #tech-not-work{{using an ethernet cable instead of wireless}} (no effect at all as I would just carry around my laptop with the cable or, after I substituted the long ethernet cable for a very short one, I would sit in an uncomfortable position close to the router for hours), #tech-not-work{{restrict access to certain websites (did not work as I know how to circumvent those limitations on a computer)}}, #tech-not-work{{putting my two computers into the basement so that it would be an extra effort for me to get it}} (I still did make that effort every day) etc... I guess when you are at a certain skill level with computers (mine is by no means that high actually), any of those soft variants won't work with you anymore. This is also what I have noticed when reading through many threads here. Granted, it probably also is a question of one's personality traits to a certain degree. In my case at least, any measures that would just limit my exposure to the Internet in a non-physical way were useless because I was willing to do what it would take to get my Internet access. Maybe the positive aspect of being this "uncompromising" in my case is that I usually don't get addicted to anything easily. I do not take any drugs, do not have any other compulsory neuroses and am generally very stable.

Long story short, I needed to find the red line that I was not willing to cross in order to satisfy my addiction. None of the aforementioned measures worked, neither did several others, and getting rid of the connection altogether is impossible because of the boyfriend. What finally did it for me was to put unplug all cables from the router (bf uses wireless) and put the device behind our 350 pounds piano where it is inaccessible. #tech-obscure-password{{The wireless password is unknown to me and it would embarass me to ask the bf for it as it would force me to "admit" my addiction in front of him}}. I brought all ethernet cables to a friend's house so even if I were to somehow get the router from behind the piano, I could still not get access via ethernet. And getting the router from behind the piano is impossible for me to do on my own because of its weight, which is why I would need help (again, admitting defeat, which I won't do).

#tech-use-outside-internet{{So now I only use the Internet when I am at university, at friends or in some other place with safe and free access.}} I have been "clean" for about half a year now and it has #ben-better-attention{{greatly increased my attention span}}, #ben-appreciate-more{{my ability to enjoy books again}} and #ben-feel-better{{my general well-being}}. I also don't feel like missing out on anything anymore, actually, I feel like I am much more informed than most people. When I am interested in a topic, I download websites/documents about it at university and read them at home in a non-distracting atmosphere (or I just get physical books about it). If I need to find a place, I look at one of the 5 maps I have acquired in the meantime (several cities, two country maps), which is actually more fun and makes sure I won't lose my geospatial skills all too soon as so many people do these days). I listen to great podcasts and other content with my walkman without needing to worry about distracting myself with other stuff or getting calls/text messages or being tracked (as I hardly ever carry around my dumbphone). I have also become much more organised about learning new things, for example by reading man-pages or longer texts on tech-related stuff instead of just searching for a quick answer to e.g. fix parts of a code without actually understanding the subject matter in a holistic way. Also, I finally feel like having to wait for something is something I can enjoy because #ben-more-patient{{I can live with delayed gratification again.}}


I guess there are some out there who are more addicted than I was and who would not be embarassed enough to hack their wireless, ask their friend for the password or move the piano (or do whatever it is in your individual cases to overcome the artificial barriers you created). I understand that, but I also know that there are ways to make it even more complicated, and I know that it absolutely pays out to make it more complicated when necessary, no matter how ridiculous it may feel to yourself or others. You can put glue into the ethernet plugs of your router to make them unusable, you can ask someone to configure their network  in a way that allows access only to their computers. If push comes to shove, you could remove the wireless card from your computer and keep a usb wifi card at your workplace/university/friends. There are *always* ways to make it impossible for you, even if you cannot get rid of Internet at home altogether (feel free to challenge me on this). And if you are the only one using your home Internet connection, definitely go ahead and get rid of it because that immediately solves the problem of having to create physical barriers at home (also get rid of your smartphone ofc, which you should not use anyway because due to its ubiquitousness is so much worse than any desktop/laptop-based Internet addiction could ever be).}}
