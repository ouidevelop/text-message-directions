#post{{I stumbled upon this subreddit and thought I'd post my positive experience from a few years ago.    
#symp-worse-school{{My freshman year I came in as a Mech e major and did terribly.}} I really had 3 problems:
    
* #symp-worse-concentration{{lack of focus and attention span (caused by the internet)}}
* poor organizational skills    
* poor fundamentals in math     
    
Before I addressed the other 2 issues I cut out all internet not related to school or work. #a-t-tv-and-movies{{Netflix}}, Social Media, #a-t-porn{{Adult Websites}}, #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}} etc.. were all banned.
    
    
After 2 weeks I started to notice big changes. I used to crack open a textbook and be unable to sit still while I was reading it. I would #symp-less-reading-comprehension{{often read a passage and forget what it was about}}. Sometimes at night I would put down my laptop or phone and #symp-worse-sleep{{not be able to fall asleep}} #symp-obsessive-thoughts{{because of excess thoughts.}}

All these problems resolved on their own after quitting. The #ben-better-school{{next semester I made the deans list!}}

These days #ben-better-attention{{I can sit and read for several hours without getting bored}}. #ben-better-memory{{I also find myself being able to recall the information I have learned much easier}}. My memory feels almost photographic. I #ben-better-sleep{{no longer have any problems falling asleep either}}. I usually #other-activities-read{{read fiction}} for 2 hours before bed, after I put the book down I fall asleep almost instantly.

I don't mean for this to sound boastful. I think everyone would experience this after quitting. It's tough but it's really worth it!

               
Good luck!
