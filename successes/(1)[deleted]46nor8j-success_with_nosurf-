#post{{So I'm an on and off lurker here, having discovered NoSurf several months ago and immediately sought to implement it.

Amongst my steps were to simplify my iPhone - #tech-delete{{getting rid of safari, social media and most other apps}} apart from those like Uber, WhatsApp, Maps, Shazam etc. #tech-delete/deactivate-account{{I also deactivated my #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}}}}, and #tech-obscure-password{{changed all of my passwords for frequently used sites}} through a password manager. Although you could say its still easy to use the manager to access these accounts, I have a long password for that too, and it really makes me think before I sign in.

I took these steps because I had important deadlines and exams looming. I was in the final year of University, and needed solid grades to get into the graduate programme and university of my choice. I had seen the #symp-less-productive{{internet prevent me from doing my best before}}, as it was an easy escape that could be slipped into with my realising whilst searching for journals or taking a quick phone break. I had also recently read #book-deep-work{{Deep Work}} by Cal Newport, which encouraged me to take an altogether more conservative approach to the information and entertainment I consumed.

I won't lie and say that I was able to refrain from mindless surfing for the entire period (maybe 2-3 months). I did still slip into habits on my laptop, but at least my phone usage dramatically improved. #tech-use-outside-internet{{I worked at the library in an exposed area}}, which stopped me from spending abnormal amounts of time on social media, or googling stupid stuff more generally. I've never really fallen into the Reddit hole, and I very nearly did with Subreddits like this one, SimpleLiving, and Privacy, but I managed to control it well enough before it became too much of an issue. For the most part, I was able to limit my use of the internet to work and #a-t-tv-and-movies{{Netflix}} in the evenings.

Adopting the habits Cal Newport described in his book, I would shut off the outside world (turn off my phone, and put on noise cancelling headphones) and would work on my essays for hours at a time. It was difficult at first, but I found my ability to critique authors and take new approaches to theories much easier to use. I did my bachelors in Law - I was able to develop my own criticisms of legal judgements, rather than just rely on articles by others and simply compare and contrast them. Simply, #ben-more-creative{{I found it much easier to think outside the box and be creative}} when I had all distractions removed from my life. I applied NoSurf to my study times and my free time. When not working or socialising, #bad-lonely{{I did begin to feel lonely}}, but I suppose that's a natural reaction to actually being alone, because that is what you are when you're spending time on social media etc. I began to cherish this feeling, as #ben-less-anxiety{{I altogether felt calmer throughout the day}} and #ben-face-difficulties{{more ready to approach my challenges}}.

#ben-better-school{{The results? I managed to graduate with a First Class degree, which is the best degree you can get in the UK (equiv to a 4.0 in American GPA terms?). I never thought that would have been possible considering that I entered my final year on a 2.2 (2 grades below)}}, but it's a fair reflection of the amount of time that I dedicated to working deeply and to the larger change I made in my relationship with the net. I'm on my dream Masters Programme, and hope to take my new habits into it to do just as well in my final year of studies as I have done in my bachelors. #ben-less-anxiety{{I think I'm generally a lot less stressed out too}}. Sure I'm missing out on celebrity gossip or the news of old friends getting into new relationships etc, but that's fine because none of that really matters. #ben-better-social-life{{I'm able to invest more time into those who do matter}}, #ben-self-improvement{{and also able to invest more time into myself}}. I feel like #ben-self-knowledge{{I know myself better now}}, simply because when I'm waiting in the car for long periods of time or commuting or doing anything else that is idle and alone, #ben-contemplation{{I can lose myself in deep thought about my goals}}, or simply watch the world around go by as a way of rest and relaxation. It sounds cheesy, but make the changes and give this way of life a chance, and you'll come to appreciate the noiselessness and hopefully thrive in it too.

I hope that gives you the motivation to stick with the changes you are trying to make. I'm happy to give tips or further insight if anybody wants.}}
