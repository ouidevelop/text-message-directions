#post{{I did a no-reddit challenge for the month of may; No posting, not event lurking for 31 days. 

*Note: I've been on this journey for a while so it's not like I went from spending hours on reddit, which I used to do A LOT, to what I'm about to share in a month. I've been slowly, and painfully, changing my relationship with compulsive internet use for years now.* 

Without further ado... 

I could say a lot about what happened during the 31 days. What is more interesting, however, was when the challenge ended and I could check reddit again. 

When I logged in a few days ago, I had three notifications. I learned this from quitting social media too, but **you cease to exist online as soon as you step away**. I know, *duh*, but what I am trying to say is that getting attention online requires putting a lot of attention, time, and energy into giving attention to others. Unfortunately, it's not even quality attention that we give and get online; passive likes, emoji comments, upvotes, etc. 

#ben-better-connection{{Talking to someone *decent* in-person for like 10 minutes is infinitely better than communicating with 10 people on Reddit. People tell you a lot of interesting stuff when you actually listen and ask questions. So, invest the time, energy, and attention spent looking for connection online to the people around you. This can be the cashier at the check out line, or you know, the family you live with and see every day.}}

Second realization is that I don't like being on Reddit anymore? I find the online space very emotionally exhausting. I can't last more than 10 minutes on the front page of reddit anymore without feeling completely drained. 

There's so much negativity online, *duh*, but until you actually step all the way away, you think it's normal. But, **it's not normal to consume negative and toxic message 10 hours a day**. It really is not. I don't know how survived being plugged in on #a-t-twitter{{Twitter}} and #a-t-reddit{{reddit}} every day. #ben-less-negativity{{It is so much nicer to spend my days without a single negative tweet or news ruining my vibe.}}

Another thing: **Everyone is saying the same thing online, following the same script**. Especially on the popular platforms like reddit and social networking sites. Same posts. Same arguments. Same 'jokes.' You remember when the Internet was actually interesting and entertaining? :'( I remember being so engrossed in reading threads and comments all day long, and literally unable to pull myself away. Now, it feels like I have seen, read, heard it all online. It's kind of boring to me. Maybe, I'm older and have the 'been there, seen that' mentality now, and have aged out of all the cool, hip stuff online. I'm 27.  

**It's so strange to have that desire to be online gone**. It was a long and hard battle, but it has been worth all the times I beat myself up for being so hopelessly addicted to reddit. #symp-negative-self-image{{There was so much self-loathing}} and #symp-feel-bad{{just feeling totally hopeless}}. I didn't even notice when the challenge came to an end. To think reddit used to run my life... I was so hopelessly addicted to this platform. Smh.

The biggest lesson is that I need to continue making my offline life more interesting and entertaining so I don't fall into the default passive and easy entertainment available online, even when I no longer enjoy it.
