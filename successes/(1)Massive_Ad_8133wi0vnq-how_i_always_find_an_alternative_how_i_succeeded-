#post{{Hi everyone, today I wanted to share my experience about nosurf. I'm sorry for my non-excellent english level, I'm a french native speaker, with russian blood, so I started to study english relatively late.

I'm actually writing from my dad's computer, which I will not be able to use anymore in 2-3 days, practically blocking me from using internet in the future, and, if God wants it, meaning a total victory against time waste. 

''I am addicted'' (I'm near to win the battle) since I'm 9 years old, when I received my first PC. At 11-12 I started to use my pc every day for 5-12 hours, depends of the day, and this situation lasted for 4 years.

But in February, I realized that I was basically #symp-wasted-time{{wasting all my time}} and that I wanted to change, to do useful stuff, to be different by my motivation and success in school, cultural spheres and all. #tech-remove-devices{{This day I just took out my pc from my room, and touched it again only when I gave it to my friend as a lil present.}}

From this day I everyday tried to improve myself, to destroy all types of addiction, because every time when I was destroying one drug (#a-t-games{{games}} for exemple), another was taking its place immediately (#a-t-youtube{{youtube}} for exemple). The last drug that I beat is internet with nosurf :) W

Today, thanks to #tech-blocker-stayfocusd{{stay focused (blocks are active forever)}} and #tech-blocker-cold-turkey{{cold turkey (every internet is blocked, some sites like my church's one are authorized)}} , I can proudly say that in some days I will definitely end with internet and waste of time. Yes, it's nice. I'm talking of some days before the total victory, because for some time I'm using my dad's pc, but I finds nothing interressant on it, and I will soon loose the possibility to use it.

Well, but what are the results ? 

1- #other-activities-read{{I really started to read by reading in 5 months of nosurf more than in my whole life}}, #ben-better-attention{{I started to gain attention and concentration,}} I speak, write and mind better than ever.

2- #ben-more-time{{I have muuuch more time}}, started to draw, think, work better, #ben-less-anxiety{{lost all my stress}}. Before, I was wasting 8 hours every day sometimes 12 hours, now I'm wasting 8 hours sometimes 10 in a whole week. Sometimes 30 minutes a day !

3- #ben-more-intentional/controlled{{I have a lot of ideas and projects for my life now}}, which I will be able to realize out of my addiction !

Peace, may God bless and help in  your battle you, who reads me.}}
