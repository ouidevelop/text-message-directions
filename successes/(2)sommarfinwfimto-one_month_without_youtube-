#post{{Greetings! Approximately three weeks ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/vvyf44/quitting_watching_youtube/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) about my experience without #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}} for a week and now I’m back to update how it’s been since then.

A lot of the things I mentioned in the first post are still relevant. Back then I was unsure if it was just a fluke that it was going well but now that more time has passed I can be more certain about my experience. I haven’t slipped up so far and I haven’t abused the “watch through reddit” exception which I’m very proud of.

However, something that I’ve started to abuse is #a-t-tv-and-movies{{Netflix}} and scrolling #a-t-reddit{{reddit}}. Naturally I needed to substitute the time I’ve spent on YouTube, unfortunately it was another internet based form of entertainment, which has reached an excessive amount. I suspected this would be an issue and although these platforms don’t make me nearly as anxious as Youtube, I’m still not pleased with the new habits that have formed.

However, since my experience for the most part has been positive I thought I’d share the things I think have made this first month relatively successful:

1. #tech-do-other-things{{Staying busy}}. Since it’s summertime my day life looks a lot different than normal, I’m working (compared to studying at uni), I live with my family (normally I live by myself) and I have access to lovely nature. I think it’s pretty self explanatory, but since I’m doing other things and have different routines than normally, I’m able to pass time where YouTube isn’t even on my mind. A part of me is worried about the transition when I go back to my regular life and that’s why I’m eager to create new habits to substitute my old YouTube habits

2. #tech-misc{{There’s a finishing line. Like I mentioned in the first post, I’ve decided to stay off of YouTube for six months and this has been a very useful detail. Every time I go through Reddit and encounter something I’d be interested in, I automatically think “well, I’ll just watch it in January instead, it’ll probably still be there by then”.}} Being able to postpone content that could potentially ruin my streak has been, in my opinion, convenient during this past month. I haven’t decided what will happen when these six months have passed but I know two things for sure: I’m not going back to how it was before and I’m not going to continue to completely refrain from consuming YouTube content.

3. #tech-out-of-sight{{Out of sight, out of mind.}} Both in terms of putting away my phone and iPad when I’m doing other things, but also staying off YouTube completely. I accidentally saw the YouTube interface when I clicked a link on Reddit and to be completely honest, that was the closest I was to a relapse. Since there is only one exception to my rules, and that one typically lets me stay on the Reddit page instead of entering YouTube, I have been able to completely ignore YouTube and its existence for the past month. The YouTube app/website is for me associated with “just one more” which usually results in an endless video watching session. So naturally, not interacting with it at all has saved me lots of time.

These are my biggest takeaways so far and although this month been mostly successful it still comes with other challenges (that I’ve tried to convey), I’m thinking of making next month even more restricted in terms of Netflix and Reddit and I’ll be back to update sometime soon regardless of my progress}}

#post{{Approximately three months ago [I decided to take a break from watching YouTube](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/vvyf44/quitting_watching_youtube/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) for the rest of 2022. [I made an update after one month](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/wfimto/one_month_without_youtube/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) and now I’m back to share my insights at the halfway mark.

Since I started this challenge during the summer my everyday life looked a lot different and I was worried how the transition from my summer life to my regular life would go. Turns out, I went really well!! I still haven’t slipped up which I’m very proud of. 

My main benefit from this challenge has been the fact that #ben-appreciate-more{{I really enjoy my life without YouTube}}. I like not being bombarded with endless recommendations for videos to watch. I like not being exposed to complete strangers lifestyle vlogs and expect me to be invested. #ben-less-anxiety{{I like not getting anxious because I notice my time slipping away but I physically cannot make my self quit watching}}. Because of this challenge #ben-more-time{{I’ve avoided a massive time consumer}} and lots of anxiety.

Of course there are things I miss and all problems in my life hasn’t disappeared since I started this challenge. #bad-practical-difficulties{{There are times I miss being able to look up educational videos about plants, embroidery or whatever}}. #bad{{I miss easily accessing home workout videos.}} There have been times when I just wanted to waste an entire evening on easy entertainment to distract myself. However I definitely think the pros outweigh the cons. I’ve found it a lot easier to incorporate other habits that I’ve wanted to focus on and I would say my quality of life has improved overall.

In conclusion, it’s been quite nice to not feel spellbound by an algorithm.}}
