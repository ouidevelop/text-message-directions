#post{{So going into this term, I was a bit less than a B-student coming off of two F's that I really shouldn't have gotten, going into two classes that I had heard were incredibly difficult. #symp-worse-school{{I spent a lot more time looking at memes than I did studying}}, but I didn't really think much of it because memes are life. Anyway, this term started out basically the same way as the last, which I didn't like, so I got desperate and, after seeing the "Focus February" thread, I decided I should eliminate some distractions, primarily social media. I stayed off of social media for all of February and only used Reddit occasionally after that.

Ironically, I got a D on the first test I took after I started my meme-fast, but that's mostly because I spent most of the day before it setting up #tech-blocker-cold-turkey{{Cold Turkey}} to block everything until this week instead of studying. Luckily, that professor let the class retake the test because everyone else bombed it too. But after that, everything was just easier. #ben-more-time{{I had one less thing to split my time for}}. #ben-better-connection{{I spent a lot more time with my friends}}, and when I wasn't with friends, I was studying. #ben-better-school{{The end result: I got my GPA back over a 3.0 (pretty comfortably too)}}, #ben-feel-better{{my mental health improved}}, #ben-better-social-skills{{my social skills improved}}, and overall, this was the best two months of my life. Needless to say, I'll be doing this again next term.}}
