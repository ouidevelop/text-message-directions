#post{{Hello guys,this is my first time posting on Reddit.I just wanted to lay down my  thoughts about the interesting subjects of Internet and digital devices use.I am 22 years old and I live in Europe.To understand my situation,I will tell you that I was a heavy internet user(#a-t-facebook{{Facebook}}, #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}}, #a-t-games{{online games}}, #a-t-tv-and-movies{{shows}}) from 2011-2018 and I am talking 7-10 hours a day.That was not normal and I would certainly classify it as an addiction.After #symp-worse-school{{I messed up the first two years of my studies}} #tech-deactivate/delete-account{{I deleted all my social media accounts}} in January 2018. #bad-lose-contact{{Many people that I used to keep in touch with cut heir ties with me}} even though they had my phone number and some even knew where my house was.Still some have not contacted me ever since.Make what you want out of it.In the summer of 2018 #tech-dumbphone{{my smartphone broke and I have been using an old flip phone ever since}}.I probably need to buy a smartphone in The future but as you can imagine after so much time I don't really care for anything else other than talking to friends or family a few days a week.Still over the past two years I have used the internet or any kind of digital devices(except phone calls a few times a week) for an average of 1 hour a week.There were even periods of time when I did not use them at all for weeks.And this  year from March-May 2020 I DID NOT USE ANY KIND OF DIGITAL DEVICES FOR TWO MONTHS! Except from an occasional phone call with friends or family.The benefits were extremely noticeable as #ben-clear-mind{{my mind became clear}},#ben-better-attention{{my concentration on studying was outstanding}} and despite the global situation #ben-appreciate-more{{I became more appreciative of he simplest moments in life}} as I spent the quarantine studying in my village.I don't want to tire you with many details about me if you want you can leave a comment or send me a personal message,but I want to get to my points:
SOCIAL MEDIA IS POINTLESS TO HAVE UNLESS YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC AND SERIOUS REASON FOR IT(that would include assignments or talking with fellow friends or workers about important projects that have to be done)

SOCIAL MEDIA ADDICTION HARMS US YOUNG PEOPLE AND CAUSES TONS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS (appearance-self esteem insecurities, the illusion that people are having fun and are in high spirits when they are not and also the illusion that you are not lonely and you are actually socializing)

INTERNET USE CAN AND SHOULD BE LIMITED TO THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM(if your work is practical and does not have to do with computers there is no excuse because in theory you could be spending zero time online if you really wanted.As for students like me and workers,internet use should be limited to specific times of the day and days of the week.An extra tip for students is to work hard on weekdays and try to leave no assignments and homework for the weekend if possible.#tech-do-other-things{{On the weekends try to fill them with practical and fun activities}} (for example I take my time grooming,#other-activities-friends-and-family{{I go out with friends}} #other-activities-read{{I read books(especially manga they are good fun!) And spiritual books about zen Buddhism}}.Also #other-activities-contemplative{{I meditate}},relax and try to leave my worries about my studies behind.In other words your free time should be filled with beneficial activities.On the weekend at least commit to not using any digital devices and stay away from the Internet,I definitely think it's possible.

MEDITATE.A LOT. (#tech-meditative-activities{{I try to meditate around 2 hours every day}} and I admit that it is the most important habit in my everyday life.Meditation can help you understand your habit patterns,make you feel calm and composed as you feel the energy inside of you and you will ultimately be happy that you are not wasting it on harmful and pointless activities.It can also help you realize how precious life is and that it should not be wasted.Just sit down for a while in a quite room without distractions and think about your life and your dreams.They don't have to be overwhelming and huge, especially if you realize what is truly important in life,making sure to grasp it and let everything else get taken away from the tides of time as they flow through your conscience.

#tech-misc{{EXERCISE FREQUENTLY}} (for example I go jogging at least 5 days a week.#tech-do-other-things{{Find a sport or an activity that you enjoy}} and that you can do often and not just once every full moon :P. Commitment is the key here .After a good workout you will feel relaxed and composed as the energy inside of you has been tamed.Not really much energy left to spend on compulsive and harmful activities.By taking good care of your physical and mental health you gradually lose the interest in activities that hamper them.

#tech-socialize-more{{FALL IN LOVE.GO ON DATES MEET PEOPLE.LOVE IS THE ULTIMATE ANSWER.}}( I am a very romantic person and people usually find it humorous or weird.But I am telling you nothing gives you the incentive to work hard on a personal level like wanting to share the gift of love with another person.Try to go on dates and meet people and you will realize that others are just like you and deep inside they all have the same needs of love,warmth and approval just like you.You won't find the acceptance and warmth you seek and deserve  by scrolling all day long.Just take care of your physical appearance but nothing too extreme or unnecessary,be open and try to talk to people and soon you will find a person that you want to build something with,that you care deeply about and you will understand why this life changing spark is literally magic,and I am telling you this as a shy person.Moreover,Stepping away from all sexual activity can be a good thing for example I remained sexually abstinent for 100 days and many more months through 2019-2020 and it can help you revision your thoughts about love and meaningful human contact.Pornography is sick and pure cancer but if you stay away from the entire PMO (as they call it) package for a while you will understand the point.

FINALLY,REMEMBER THAT YOU WILL NOT REGRET STEPPING AWAY FROM SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE INTERNET AT ALL(Loneliness,boredom,stress from leaving them behind may appear but let me assure you, you will be thanking yourself in the future with the healthy life that you will have.Sticking only with what is truly important will give you a sense of fulfillment and purpose in life despite all the difficulties so you will be proud of yourself and your accomplishments.As for the Internet use I suggest making a clear distinction between your work and your personal life.Tutors and bosses don't care at all about our mental well-being but we are only humans in the end not slaves ...That is what I personally believe.So take as much time  away from any kind of screens as possible,no buts or ifs about crappy blocker extensions or dumb tricks that you are telling to yourselves because trust me these are excuses when you start to work on the hardcore mode and if I could do it,you damn well too can.You don't have to become a monk but to tell you the truth,there is nothing wrong with being strict with yourself.It will undoubtedly pay off.
I would like to hear your opinions on these subjects,leave comments and if you want to talk about meditation,spiritualism,other activities regarding self improvement and overall well being or whatever you want send me a message.Thank you for your time.}}
