#post{{When I started looking for new places to live, I decided to use the move as an opportunity to create new habits. Among those was changing the way I use the internet. I wasn't going to have roommates, so it would be my decision alone. It helped that I chose a place (my current one) where #tech-use-outside-internet{{I cannot install wifi without having a technician come out and charge me lots of moneys.}} #ben-saved-money{{I used that as an opportunity to put what I'd been paying for internet into my savings every month.}}

I didn't forsee that #tech-misc{{signal would be awful here}}, but that worked to my benefit as well. Every time I wanted to tether my computer to my phones data, or watch something on my phone, I'd have to walk around for better signal and wait for things to load slowly. I'd get impatient and move on to a non internet activity. Or if I needed to go online for an extended period of time, I had to leave the house and go to the library.

This has essentially forced me to be intentional with my internet use. I still notice my reflex to grab my phone when I'm bored and not home, but I don't habitually open my laptop for entertainment anymore no matter where I am. Surfing the internet without some kind of goal actually feels uncomfortable for me now. 

Other ways:
- #a-t-reddit{{reddit}} #tech-curate-content{{subscribe. Now all the new posts are on one page and I don't need to hop around a bunch of subreddits and get lost.}}
- #tech-curate-content{{RSS feed}}. This makes it so that I can enjoy my own selected content without the distraction of the rest of the website. I can follow blogs without having accounts on those sites and without having to seek them out every time I want to check them. I just go on feedly, read the new stuff, then log off. This has been super helpful in getting me to quit #a-t-tumblr{{Tumblr}} for good.
- #tech-delete{{Deleted}} #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}} and #a-t-snapchat{{snap chat}}. I only have 4 social media accounts now, and I only log onto them when I have a reason. (Most of my reasons wouldn't make sense to other people.)
- #tech-track-time{{Rescue time}}. I have it on my computer and my phone. Seeing all of my internet usage laid out in front of me like that is a really jarring reality check sometimes.

I use the (free) time now to #other-activities-read{{read books}} and #other-activities-offline-games{{play video games}}. Yeah video games are technically a time wasting activity, but #symp-wasted-time{{I spent so much time online doing jack}} that I didn't even have time to waste on a game. I tire of them quickly, so getting addicted to them hasn't been an issue for me. }}
