#post{{Recently, I decided not to use #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}} or any other time-wasting site until my exams were finished.  Apparently 29 days ago I posted a thread saying pretty much that. I was fairly successful. I totally avoided Reddit and the other worst time-wasting sites, I got #other-activities-read{{more reading done than normal}}, #other-activities-work{{started working on what hopefully will turn out to be a mathematics paper}}, #other-activities-work{{applied for some internships}}, #other-activities-learn{{studied pretty well for my tests}} and #other-activities-play-music{{started recording songs that I have written}}, so #ben-productive{{I was definitely more productive than normal}}. I still wasted some time but not as badly as before.

I plan next to go totally cold turkey for a few months, then after that allow myself to use the internet when I have a predetermined purpose, only for an hour or so a week.

I had a few thoughts about motivation and maybe other less extreme ways of cutting down on your browsing time. I made a separate thread on it.}}
