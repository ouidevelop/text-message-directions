#post{{Positives,

1. #ben-more-time{{A ridiculous amount of free time.}}

2. #ben-clear-mind{{Brain fog disappeared.}}

3. #ben-better-physical-health{{Better eyesight, especially focusing.}}

4. #ben-less-pain{{Neck and upper back pain vanished.}}

5. #ben-productive{{Slowly learned to feel happy by finishing incremental tasks and being productive without immediate reward.}}

6. You can't ghost your evil ex so she slowly becomes about as significant as Joe Biden's next press speech. Zero.

7. You make sure there is always food at home. And essentials. 


Negatives,

1. #withdrawal-sick{{The withdrawal is no joke. Mentally I felt sick in the beginning, I was arguing with myself.}}

2. #bad-practical-difficulties{{Having no GPS / Google Maps is not possible when living in a city, it is torture}}. I asked for directions and the dude changed sidewalks as if he would be attacked.

3. #withdrawal-difficult-thoughts-and-feelings{{There are many moments that you begin to catastrophize and think excessively because there is nothing to do. No matter how productive you may be. But this goes away (very) slowly.}}

4. #bad-practical-difficulties{{Applications such as ordering food, watching movies, chatting, especially googling something, they're gone. And missed. So when that night comes where your fridge is empty and you want that pizza, all you do instead is go to bed, cry, listen to your stomach gargle and say "another wondiferous night".}}

5. The moment you return to the phone, the dopamine rush is so beautiful and slow and wholesome that you stick around. But, believe me, the "addiction" fades away with every successful withdrawal of a few days or so. Basically, the whole situation becomes so annoying and boring that you "lose interest" to the phone itself. Think of it as a long-distance relationship with a Russian girl. If you know, you know.


Traps,

Many but if there is one worth mentioning, it is the false belief that phone usage equals reward for "good behavior". For example, when I would go through a stress and then calm down, immediately I wanted to "reward" myself with a treat, my phone. You have to register the phone in your brain as a "lame" activity. Boring, lame, unfulfilling, unhealthy, that it will make you ugly, or your pee pee small etc. You get the point.


Solutions,

Yes, a small-ish smart/dumb phone with just Google Maps and email would be amazing. However, for the time being, just a basic dumb phone will do well and you can install a GPS device in your car. 

I am flying away again tonight for good, I hope.

Extra tips,
#tech-remove-devices{{Remove your TV}}. It is the next best thing you're automatically gonna be snorting. I saw the entire list of movies starring Laurence Olivier, Laughton and some 1930 dracula on Netflix. And did I say The Witcher is back? And yes, it is just as bad as season 1. Remove your #tech-remove-devices{{game consoles, computers, gameboys}}. At least I did. Sold them all. But no one wants to buy my smart phone yet.

Last moment thoughts,
I do not know what age you're all at but for me, I never liked social media or the Internet much. In fact, I remember that ever since Internet Cafe places popped up and then MSN, #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}} etc, it did more harm than good. However, I can't stop or change progress. I can, however, choose how to live my life. You reach a point in life (youngins won't get it yet but older folks here will) where anything that messes with your stress levels / mentally, you simply eject it from the passenger's seat. No questions, no buts. So, since the phone is an unlimited source of brain melting and so much more, to hell with it and let me be that special kid in the table that doesn't have a camera or Insta. Yeah, I also don't have a charger, #ben-battery-life{{because my phone lasts a week.}}

Good luck.



EDIT: also some positives worth mentioning that I forgot are,

1. #ben-less-pain{{Elbow pain and numbing of fingers or the area vanished}}

2. #ben-better-physical-health{{Lazy eye vanished}} (I had that prior, it happens when you scroll too much too fast)

3. #ben-better-attention{{Attention span increased}} and #ben-mentally-stable{{mentally stable}}, #ben-less-anxiety{{more calm}}, this is due to the f@cking "shorts", be extremely careful, they are death}}
