#post{{Hey guys just want to share my experience without social media. It's changed my life for the better #ben-better-attention{{no distractions at all}}. Not trying to impress people with what I brought or posting every single time I go somewhere eg: sporting grounds, cafe's, shops etc. Just trying to grab attention for something that doesn't matter my screen time on my phone is about 30min a day. #other-activities-exercise{{So this allows me to exercise}}, #other-activities-journal{{journal}}, #other-activities-socializing{{spend time with family}} and make time for myself. Most people spend most of their day scrolling through a phone with no benefit at all. I'm not impress people #ben-more-self-esteem{{I'm just being myself and loving myself for what I am}}. You will feel such a happiness without social media I promise.}}
