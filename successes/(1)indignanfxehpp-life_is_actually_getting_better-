#post{{I decided to #tech-delete{{delete all my social media}} (save for Snapchat and WhatsApp because I use them purely to text friends) a little less than a month ago.

Deleting #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}} has #ben-better-physical-health{{helped me begin recovery from an eating disorder}}, #other-activities-read{{allowed me to find joy in reading again}}, #other-activities-exercise{{motivated me to start exercising}}, and #ben-more-time{{given me countless hours}} every single day to #ben-productive{{be productive}}. While before, I just dragged myself through each day, waiting for the time to pass, #ben-feel-better{{I’ve now actually begun to enjoy living}}. My average screen time so far this week is one hour.

I think I picked the best time to get rid of social media. I can’t imagine what would have happened had I given in to my addiction during quarantine. I’d probably be spending at least 10 hours a day on my phone.

#ben-freedom{{I feel so free, I kind of want to cry}}.}}
