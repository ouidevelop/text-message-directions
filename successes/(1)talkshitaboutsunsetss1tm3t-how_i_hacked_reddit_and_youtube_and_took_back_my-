#post{{You ever just procrastinate the task of living? That was me in 2017. #symp-misc{{I was a NEET}}, spending 16 hours a day on #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}} and #a-t-youtube{{Youtube}}. Fast forward to 2022 and #ben-better-school{{I'm in college with mostly A's}}, #ben-better-social-life{{have an active social life}} and #other-activities-art{{have taken up painting}}, #other-activities-read{{reading}}, #other-activities-art{{digital art}}, #other-activities-writing{{writing}} and #other-activities-exercise{{cycling}}. Here is what I did.

1. #tech-therapy{{went to therapy and stopped avoiding my emotions}}
2. set up my digital ecosystem to support good habits
   1. #tech-curate-content{{Created a new youtube account on a new device and curated it to only show me high quality educational content}}
   2. #tech-blockers{{set up blocks on all devices where youtube and reddit are only accessible at certain times. blocked specific subreddits that were addicting}}. used the #tech-youtube-extension{{Distraction Free Youtube app to avoid recommended content}}
   3. If I wanted to watch youtube or go on reddit during those times (2-5pm and after 8pm) I could, and consume whatever content I wanted
   4. If I ever got around the blocks, #tech-misc{{forgave myself}} and troubleshooted to come up with better blocks
   5. #tech-do-other-things{{Starting doing things I actually want to do with my time}}, thus largely forgetting to go on social media when it was available
   6. ???
   7. profit

4 years later, I no longer am addicted to the internet. Neither am I a Luddite. I use technology mostly intentionally with a few fuck ups because I am human (:

&amp;#x200B;

Edited to add: I used #tech-blocker-freedom{{Freedom}} and #tech-blocker-cold-turkey{{Cold Turkey}} for blocking.}}
