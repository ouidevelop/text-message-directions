#post{{Hey guys! Im a 21 year old guy. I have posted here before, kinda dead sub tho. Which considering the topic/aim of the sub is understandable. I used to feel a lot of #symp-guilt{{guilt}} surfing here, and had absolutely no wish to post here. As i felt a lot of guilt just #symp-wasted-time{{wasting my time}}.

I've been hanging around here for a good half year, and I had an additional 1 year before that when i felt my internet usage came in the way of my life. #symp-bored{{I had no interest in other activities}}. But my surfing was not purposeful either, mainly just reading stupid #a-t-reddit{{reddit}} comments. And eventhough i was aware of how pointless the surfing was i kept doing it. I could easily spend a good 10 hours a day on this site, and still re*meme*bering nothing of what i read or did. #symp-less-clean{{My room was filled with unwashed clothes and plates with food in stacks.}}

Meanwhile i stayed at home from my first of uni, #symp-worse-school{{failing all my courses}}. Socialising with good frinds and course friends made me very anxious. But it did not bother me the slightest. I just wanted to do nothing/surf/relax even though #symp-feel-bad{{it made me feel like shit}}. I felt that it was just my weak/bad character that made me act this way.


Anyway I went to do doctor, due to my mum. It felt pointless, as i didn't feel my actions was not out of my control and i had no wish to die. However the doctor diagnosed me with a light depression. And eventhough the word "light" seems it would just be something you could handle, in my case it just made me do nothing but sit on reddit for 3 months. I'm a month into #tech-not-work{{medication}} now and I have absolutely no wish to spend my days on reddit. I have no problem visiting the fronpage here for five minutes and risking getting stuck in sub-jumping for 8 hours, as it does'nt intrest me.

Hope this helps at least someone. Excuse my lacking english as i have not studied it for 3 years now.

Just pm me if you want to talk or add me on skype : Z e e 7w a N7 i nj a (no spaces or 7's, want to avoid spam)

**TLDR: Spent all day on internet, filling my room with trash messing up my studies, turns out i had a depression and medication helped me get out of the loop pretty quickly** just the read the text it's a 3 min read.

If you are anything like i was, i know how hard it is to gather the will to read even this short of a text. But do it, it might change your life.}}
