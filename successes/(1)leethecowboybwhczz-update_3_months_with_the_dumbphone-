#post{{It's going well. I had an iPhone, a gift from my mom several years ago, and recently it finally decided to break. I felt relieved-- I was gonna use it till the end, 'cause I didn't wanna waste money, but when it stopped working I felt good.

#tech-dumbphone{{I have an LG flip phone and one of those little adorable clip-on MP3 players now.}}

&amp;#x200B;

Problems I didn't anticipate:

* \- #bad-practical-difficulties{{I have no directional sense without GPS. Had to rely a lot more on those bus maps.}}
* \- #bad-practical-difficulties{{my LG flip has a camera but it can't send images. Might be my phone plan.}}

&amp;#x200B;

Things I thought would be problems but really aren't:

* \- I'm not getting bored of the music  I have. Turns out I really enjoy listening to the same twelve albums over and over. I'm always in the mood to listen to Marina and the Diamonds while I run.
* \- It's NOT hard to put podcasts on the mp3 player either, and that's mostly what I'm listening to right now.
* \- Texting isn't that hard. I've gotten really good at the T9, and nobody is THAT offended when I give 'em a plain old call. I just go, "can i call you, its annoying to text on this thing" and they're usually down.
* \- NO NICE PHOTOS WITH FRIENDS??? welllllll I'm an artist so it turns out it's a lot more fun and memorable to draw my friends' portraits when we hang out. No fancy camera required, and even if it's just with shitty restaurant crayons, people LOVE to be drawn. it makes them so happy and I love that

Positives:

* \-When I'm out and about, #other-activities-think{{I do a lot more thinking}}, #other-activities-being{{people watching}}, #other-activities-misc{{birdwatching,}} and #ben-notice-more{{I'm generally more aware of my environment}}. It's never boring.
* \- my phone is tiny and it fits in any pocket.
* \- #ben-battery-life{{my devices both hold a charge for days and days}}
* \-it's really fun to flip the phone open and closed
* **Most importantly: I've experienced a kind of "herd smartphone" effect, where even if I don't have a smartphone, since so many people around me DO, I'm never really without the perks of one. I can always ask a friend, "hey, can you please google \_\_\_?" or "Can you take a picture of this and email it to me?" or "Please play \_\_\_\_\_\_, it's my new favorite song."**}}
