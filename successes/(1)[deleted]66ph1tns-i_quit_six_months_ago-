#post{{**tl;dr: Six months ago, I stopped being addicted to screens. This is how I got to that point and what the effects of stopping were on my life.** 

I’m 44 so I grew up without the internet, but I was always very much into screens: TV, movies, computer games… When the internet emerged around 1997, I could take or leave it at first. My real addiction started in 2009 when I moved to a new city where I didn’t know anyone, bought a brand new laptop and then lost my job. Suddenly I found myself with a lot of time on my hands, not a lot of people around me and fast, unlimited internet on a beautiful new machine.

It soon became a crutch, a delicious way to press pause on things that were hard to face in my real life. Often #symp-tired{{I would surf until I was too tired to feel anything but fatigue}}. I’d spend my time on social media, reading the #a-t-news{{news}}, #a-t-self-help{{self-help articles}}, stupid #a-t-games{{games}}, #a-t-reddit{{reddit}}, #a-t-youtube{{youtube}}, bingewatching lots of #a-t-tv-and-movies{{TV shows}}… a day would fly by, and I stayed online until well into the night.

After about four months of this, I had to face reality: my money was gone, I had no job, nothing. At age 32, I moved back to my parents’ house and got a job waitressing. At work, I met my partner who motivated me to sign up for a teaching degree and I soon found an internship. We moved in together and things seemed to be going somewhere for me again. 

But the screen addiction never actually left. Sure I had less time now that I had stuff going on, but it was still my go-to when I felt overwhelmed. Which happened a lot. The result was that #symp-worse-work{{I was often late for work}}, #symp-worse-sleep{{didn’t sleep enough}}, #symp-worse-school{{arrived at my internship classes unprepared and missed lots of deadlines for my degree because I had spent the time I should have been doing my assignments scrolling}} social media and reddit. It eventually took twice as long to get my degree. But I finished it eventually.

Life rolled on, things got busy when we had a baby, and then another one. We’re a close-knit family and spending time with them is what makes me genuinely happy. So it was a mystery to me that #symp-worse-social-life{{I sacrificed time with them to my screen addiction}}. I was desperate to stop but couldn’t seem to get it done. I remember promising my kids that I would quit once and for all, but it never happened. Not proud of that one.

I tried #tech-not-work{{therapy}}, #tech-not-work{{medication}}, #tech-not-work{{micro-dosing}}, #tech-not-work{{hypnosis}}, #tech-not-work{{meditation}}, #tech-not-work{{self-help}}, #tech-not-work{{setting up complicated systems, blocks and time slots in which I wasn’t allowed to use the internet}} but nothing worked. I have to use the internet and a smartphone for work and for the kids so I couldn’t just get rid of them. Sometimes something worked for about two or three days and then I fell back into apathetic scrolling. It sucked. I also spent time here at /r/nosurf, and it helped to see that I was not alone. And that screen addiction is not as innocent as the world lulls you into thinking.

Meanwhile, #symp-anxiety{{I was stressed}}. #symp-worse-work{{My professional life was suffering}}, #symp-worse-social-life{{my kids were acting out because of their frustrations with me}}, #symp-less-clean{{my house was not a pleasant place to be in terms of tidiness and cleanliness}}, #symp-looked-worse{{I looked a mess}}. The cumulative cost of this addiction was in my face all day, and the way I dealt with it was to -you guessed it- go online and do something “fun”. Give myself a break.

Then I came across the book #book-smart-phone-dumb-phone{{Smart Phone Dumb Phone}}, by Allen Carr. The smoking guy. I knew some people who had quit smoking with his easyway method, so I thought- why not? But I was jaded- nothing had worked so far, so I didn’t really believe this would work. #tech-misc{{The premise of easyway is that you understand your addiction so well that it takes away the desire to use, rather than fighting against that desire with willpower.}}

I read it over the course of three days. And then I just stopped. 

The first five days or so, I still picked up my phone and sometimes even opened my go-to apps out of habit, but then I thought- ah, no, I don’t do that anymore. And closed them. That habit was gone quite quickly. After five days, I did a big purge: #tech-unsubscribe{{I stopped following most people on social media}} and #tech-delete{{deleted the apps I didn’t feel the need for anymore}}. I kept some apps because I like the idea of being able to contact old friends and sometimes they have a practical use. But I don’t check them anymore, there’s literally nothing there.

#withdrawal-time{{The first three months or so, I had to spend some time coming face to face with all the feelings and things I had been avoiding}}. Not gonna lie, that was heavy. Instead of numbing myself with screentime, I tried to just sit with those feelings, and feel them. #withdrawal-anxiety{{Anxiety is a bitch, and I spent hours, just curled up in a ball, crying and feeling that awful cold feeling in the pit of my stomach}}. But as I sat with it, it lessened. And #other-activities-contemplative{{I spontaneously started meditating}}. I had tried it before (of course) but this time it was different: it was something I wanted to do, rather than something I made myself do because people say it’s good for you.

#other-activities-read{{I also started reading books again.}}

#ben-productive{{There was a huge backlog of work, in all areas of my life. I chipped away at it, and I’m proud to say, that now, six months later, everything is in way better shape}}. #ben-less-anxiety{{This in turn reduces my anxiety a lot}}. I still get anxious about the state of the world but it’s not so crippling anymore.

My phone and the internet are now tools for me, tools I use when I need them, like a pair of scissors. I look up the information I need, but I don’t feel the need to know anyone’s opinion on everything anymore. I communicate with people one on one. I use it for work. Sporadically, I’ll find myself being curious about a person I have in my friend list, and I go to my app, look that person up and maybe send them a hello, but that happens maybe twice a month. I still love Netflix, but I watch it while I’m doing something else that doesn’t require any brainpower- my nails, folding laundry or doing the dishes. Or I watch a movie after a long day, snuggled up with some tea and popcorn. It’s like I now know how to use it for genuine relaxation rather than trying to run away from something. 

I wanted to share my story, because these were the kind of stories I loved reading here. Maybe it can give someone some hope or support today. I must say that it probably was easier for me to quit than the majority of people on here, because I’m older and experience a lot less peer pressure when it comes to use of social media. I see apps like Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok wreaking havoc on the lives of my students and I feel for them, and for whoever is reading this that has a problem with it. Their design and the way they’ve wormed their way into young people’s lives is just insidious… 

Also good to know: I don’t work for Allen Carr and I’m not getting any money to say this. His method just worked for me, but maybe you’re wired differently. All I’m trying to say here is- keep looking for something that works for you, because it is possible to overcome this addiction and it is worth it. Life is much nicer now.}}
