#post{{#tech-socialize-more{{1. Socialization. I lacked fulfilling friendships and social activity and used technology as a loneliness bandaid. A full social calendar staves off the emotional need to seek social validation and connection online.}}
2. #tech-medication{{SSRIs}} - I take Lexapro. Calmed the compulsions right away. I'm predisposed to OCD in my family but even without therapy it helped.
3. My Kindle genuinely gave me back the ability to read. 
4. #tech-do-other-things{{Making car travel more enjoyable so I do more stuff and am willing to travel for it.}}
5. #tech-misc{{Reading self help and taking care of my appearance, confidence, and self esteem.}}

Far from where I want to be but I've gone from terminally online to a normie "addict." Hoping to kick it in the butt by the end of the year. Make your life worth living &lt;3}}
