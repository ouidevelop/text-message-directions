#post{{Background: I am a professional software engineer for more than 15 years. Before that I used to program as hobby. I have been in front of a screen 75% of my life. 

While it wasn't a problem early on, the advent of social media + smartphones made me into an addict. I was in front a screen every waking moment (either for programming or social media) 

I began to notice the following problems: 

* I began to notice that I'm #symp-worse-work{{'slowing down' in my job}}. I initially put it down to my age ( young programmers are sharper, I'm in my late 30's now).
* My #symp-worse-communication{{writing and conversation skills became poorer}} ( very important for everyone, including a senior developer who talks to clients like me)
* #symp-worse-social-skills{{My social skills became poorer}}. I'd rather stare at a phone screen than talk to people. I justified this saying "oh I'm a geek"
* I used to tinker around with computers a lot, but I don't anymore. I am more interested in everything else, from geopolitics to religion to the afterlife! ( It's not bad having interests, but my core competency of being a programmer started getting affected) 
* Being well-paid, I bought every distraction I could. iPhone, iPad and an Android phone. Playstation, Xbox, you name it, I have it. 

I had everything yet I was #symp-anxiety{{always anxious}}. Something had to be done about this.

* I #tech-remove-devices{{got rid of all my gadgets other than my iPhone}}. I formatted it and I #tech-delete{{only keep Apple apps}} that are pre-loaded on the device. No unnecessary notifications from #a-t-twitter{{Twitter}}/#a-t-facebook{{FB}}/#a-t-pinterest{{Pinterest}}/#a-t-news{{BBC/CNN}} etc. To check news, i use the built-in browser.
* I #tech-downgrade{{bought a Sony MP3 player}}. I curated the top 100 songs I listen to and copied it over to the walkman. I started jogging without being distracted with notifications. ( I know you can silent your phone, but I am addict. It's like telling an alcoholic - 'hey go to a bar with your friends and drink only soda' - it's very very difficult)
* I #tech-tool-kindle{{bought an Amazon Kindle and started re-reading books I used to like - this is just so that I could regain the reading habbit.}}
* #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}} would be restricted to my personal computer, no mobile Reddit app anywhere.
* #tech-app{{I use the 'wind down' feature in iOS to stop all notifications from 9PM to 9AM. Calls from selected friends/family are white-listed}}

&amp;#x200B;

I have noticed a dramatic #ben-better-memory{{improvement in my ability to retain things in my head}}. I feel #ben-less-anxiety{{less anxious}} now. I feel #ben-less-anxiety{{more at peace}}. #ben-less-fomo{{FOMO is (almost) gone}}.

We cannot live without gadgets in today's world. But we can reclaim our lives from them}}
