#post{{Hello there

#tech-dumbphone{{I used dumb phone for 50 days and never used my smartphone}}

Now I'm back at my smartphone because I think I need it for some meditation voice and some books 

I think I was mindful of other people when I didn't have the smartphone and #ben-appreciate-more{{I think I was enjoying my life more than before}}

#ben-better-social-life{{I enjoyed being with people and taking to them}} #ben-notice-more{{I enjoyed noticing around myself}} and #ben-being-present{{being in (now) instead of living in my phone}}

I think I'll be living my smartphone again soon and be living my life Once again the way I should

Or maybe find a feature phone and use that instead for meditation voices and other necessary apps like WhatsApp.

Speaking of WhatsApp I still don't know if I should open the messages and see what was going on there since I don't wanna get deep into WhatsApp again and get addicted again}}
