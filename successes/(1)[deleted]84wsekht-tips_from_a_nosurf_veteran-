#post{{Bit of tongue in cheek title, but I've been doing NoSurf since 2020 and wanted to share some tips and tricks I've learned and picked up. Made this account, will stick around and then delete this account, cause not staying here lmaoo. 

**Firstly, what does NoSurf look like?** 

I learned that there is not one way to do NoSurf, I still use the internet. But I don't use social media . #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}}, #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}}, #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}}, #a-t-youtube{{Youtube}}, #a-t-twitter{{Twitter}}, #a-t-tiktok{{TikTok}} and #a-t-snapchat{{Snapchat}} are all platforms I don't use. I used to spend my life on these platforms. Heck, my life was these platforms.

I do use Spotify, email and sometimes Netflix (only intentionally though). Along with some online courses, on Udemy.

I also do lots of googling, and researching random topics. But that's just my personality! :D

**Secondly, what's my number one tip?** 

You need to replace social media, with just as fullfilling and dopamine filled activities. It's been a long road and first its hard because you have to go out and make your own algorithm. You have to actively search for your dopamine. I get mine from my hobbies, #other-activities-play-music{{(music composition}}, #other-activities-art{{painting}}) #other-activities-music-listening{{music (i'm listening to the new Nicki Minaj while typing this)}}, #other-activities-misc{{podcasts}}, #other-activities-read{{books}} and #other-activities-socializing{{friends}}.

#tech-misc{{Podcasts podcasts podcasts. These got me off social media completely. I find you can know more about the internet and whats going on social media through podcasts than actually scrolling.}}

Maybe listening to pop culture, news, political commentary, comedy and lifestyle podcasts is breaking some sort of NoSurf rule. But for me, I'm not surfing, so it's a success. I also feel connected, more connected actually.

So yes, find what is your equivalent to what podcasts did for me. 

Also don't make NoSurf bigger than it needs to be. Don't make it a dopamine detox, NoFap, slow living, no caffeine, new diet, self improvement, minimalism and no social media challenge. Just focus on getting rid of social media. Make it simple and easy as possible

**Thirdly, do I miss it?** 

Yes, I did, nothing like a TikTok algorithm curated exactly to what would make you laugh. But now I rarely do. It does nothing for me, and means nothing to me. Occasionally a podcast dips into whats happening on Tiktok so I learn through that. And that reminds me why I remain off TikTok and other social media. 

**Fourthly, what is my opinion on social media?**

It's changed, significantly. At first, I hated it, it was vermin to me, a abomination to this earth, it was the source of all disharmony in society, it was the problem in my life,  it was the reason the world was crumbling and it was ruining society and humanity. Now I'm neutral. Social media is great. Its a great tool if you know how to use it. It's also not a good representation of the real world AT ALL, but yes of course it has an influence. I'm a sociology student so I could write a whole ass essay on this, but my toast is about to pop. 

**Final thoughts?** 

Get off social media if you want to. If you don't want to, don't. 

Also, It won't solve all your problems. It doesn't have that much power. (trust me)

Hope you guys find harmony and peace! &lt;3}}
