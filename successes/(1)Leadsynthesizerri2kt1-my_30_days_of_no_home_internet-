#post{{I've been meaning to try it for years, but I finally went for 30 days of #tech-no-home-internet{{no home Internet}}. I just thought, screw it, and I unplugged my router and all my ethernet cables and left them at the office. Well, in reality it was more like 24 days because the last three weekends I brought the stuff back home so I could game with my friends on Sunday nights. That's still something I value.

The first week #ben-less-anxiety{{I felt calm and serene for not having the option to go online}}, like a toddler wrapped tightly in a blanket. I felt silly for being so dependent on the Internet once. I started writing stuff down to check them later. #ben-misc{{My home started to feel like my fortress of solitude where the world couldn't get to me}}. #other-activities-play-music{{I made some progress on a music project}}, #other-activities-read{{I read more}}, #other-activities-journal{{I journaled more}}, #ben-better-sleep{{I slept better}}, #ben-better-self-care{{I ate better and I just took better care of myself}}. I couldn't believe I ever had time to be online!

#withdrawal-time{{After the first week}}, #withdrawal-misc{{being offline was getting more difficult. I started to fill my time with offline stimulation (yes, it's a thing), things like consuming and distracting myself with old music and movies on my harddrive.}}

On the second weekend I brought the router home to game with friends. My mind immediately started toying with the idea of plugging it in. After a crazy week at work, my mind told me that I deserved it. And so I plugged it in. Immediately, a popup ironically appeared and wished me "Welcome back!". Everything needed updates, apparently. I was back online again, and the world was already nagging me.

Come third week, I was back on the horse again. My sleep got better again and I had more mental energy after work. Being offline after work started to feel like the new normal. I knew I wouldn't die from it. But I was still distracting myself with offline content a lot. I was multitasking again. It felt a lot like being online, actually. I would get the same sort of feeling after turning it offâ€”like when you turn off a noisy fan and go "aaaah that's better".

When the last week rolled around, my document of "things to do online" was empty. I didn't feel the need to go online anymore. I had learned to distract myself in other ways.

After the last weekend I forgot to take the router back to work. My willpower faltered and I plugged it in for a bit one night.

So what did I learn?

* I sleep better on weekdays without the Internet.
* Weekdays offline are not that difficult. Weekends are hard.
* If I have the option to go online, I will.
* The Internet fills up time that I don't really have, time that should be spent taking care of myself.
* It doesn't matter whether I'm online or not. I find ways to distract myself in any case.
* Offline stimulation feels as crappy as online stimulation. They both kidnap 	the mind.
* Most of all, the Internet is not my scapegoat anymore.}}
