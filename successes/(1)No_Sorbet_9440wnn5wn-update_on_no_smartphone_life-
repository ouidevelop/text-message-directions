#post{{I made a post near the beginning of summer about #tech-dumbphone{{switching out my iphone for a flip phone}} as my addiction and adhd was running rampant. My quality of life had become so poor that even getting up to use the bathroom while scrolling felt like a challenge that took way too much mental energy.

So, i'm back for an update (on my PC of course)

So far its been amazing, #withdrawal-bored{{at first I was super bored}} but then I just...started doing things! I have been outside almost every day whether I am out #other-activities-misc{{looking for cool rocks and fossils}} or just #other-activities-walk{{enjoying a nice hike}}, or #other-activities-read{{reading outside in the shade}}. #symp-worse-concentration{{Reading was something I couldn't manage for longer than five minutes}} and #symp-worse-school{{was causing my grades in college to plummet}}...now I can enjoy it again like I used to as a kid. #other-activities-exercise{{Apparently I really, really like river swimming, who knew?}}

It has me wondering if I truly have ADHD or if having a smart phone from the age of 12 seriously messed up my attention span...or maybe the ADHD was aggravated by the device, who knows. I'm not gonna bother messing with my medication until i'm back in class so I can know for sure.

#ben-saved-money{{That and my plan is now 20 dollars a month compared to 70-80!}}

Now for the drawbacks..

As much as it has impacted me positively, I'll note that there are some hurtles to jump over.

#bad-practical-difficulties{{My gym switched from plastic barcodes to an iPhone app to check in for "sanitary reasons" which I never got because nobody else is touching my key?}}

Music. I didn't even think about music until I had none! This problem was solved by a good ol MP3 player and youtube to mp3 converter like the good ol days.

#bad-difficulties-with-others{{People. Holy crap is it ever annoying to get people to send a text as a text and not an imessage. I turned off imessage on my old apple ID and factory reset it but for some reason people won't stop trying to add me to imessage group chats, including for work...like come on not everyone has an iphone, I know plenty of people who prefer samsung smartphones.}}

#bad-lose-contact{{Some people have completely stopped talking to me simply because I am no longer an active #a-t-facebook{{facebook}} or #a-t-instagram{{instagram}} user despite me giving them my phone number to contact me (yes they have a working phone)}}

I've had one person throw a tantrum for not responding within an hour on facebook...after I gave him my phone number and explained the situation in detail, yet he still did not grasp it. Its like people won't believe you actually don't use social media like you used to and still expect you to answer on their platform of choice, rather than just calling or texting. This has been the most aggravating part, not everyone wants to watch their social media notifications from sunrise to sunset. Good riddance I suppose. I keep facebook to occasionally check up on family but that's about it, I should honestly just perma delete instagram.}}
