#post{{As a person in recovery from tech use, I've avoided creating a reddit account for obvious reasons. However, I was so impressed with what you all have created here to support each other, I just had to sign in and send you a shout out.  Way to go /r/nosurf reddit users. 

When I began using tech, there was no reddit. But there were tech addicts. We just didn't have a support system. No one to talk to. No one to get support from. In fact, we didn't even have words to describe what we were experiencing. Many of us didn't even know what to call what we were going through. We just felt depressed, sad, and lonely. And the way many of us dealt with our feelings was to spend more time online. Yes, we escaped before there was a term for it.

When I made the conscious decision to dramatically change my own tech use, the sheer desire to use intensified. I thought about being online more, and more, and a strong urge to use seemed like a relentless companion. #withdrawal-urges{{I found the cravings and the constant desire to use}} was always present and in the back of my mind. In fact, #withdrawal-time{{it took a long time to feel different, roughly 7 long years.}}

But over the years what took it's place is so much greater than anything I could have ever imagined. All the energy I had channeled into online activities, I redirected into other pursuits, hobbies, interests and passions. That said, I’ve never forgotten how tech use hijacked my life, and where I would have been had I not made that fateful decision to change long ago.

So today, Nosurf reddit members, I salute you. Keep up the good work. It's needed.  . . . I know.

Stay strong. Be open to change. Life is worth it.

Although I’m just passing through for a short time, I’d be happy to provide support while I’m here.
