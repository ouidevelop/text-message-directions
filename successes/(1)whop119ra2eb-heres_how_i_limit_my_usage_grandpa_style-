#post{{My Grandpa is close to 90 &amp; uses his PC like once a week, I saw that he just writes stuff down on a piece of paper -what he wants to do/research/find before ever turning the PC on- A great idea!

So this is what I do nowadays, I turn on my Laptop only like once a day, beforehand #tech-plan-internet-time{{whenever I have an urge to see something/find/research I write it all down on a simple piece of paper with a regular pen, than when I have Loads of stuff written down- I turn on the PC and just do them 1 by one}}, I do not do anything else that's not written on the list, If i want to do additional tasks I write them down first! After I'm done with all the tasks on my list- I turn the Laptop Off and that's it!


In result you can still do all the things you want to do,you DO NOT HAVE TO LIMIT YOURSELF although I have stopped watching movies/tv-shows myself as it was a serious time consumer, you can do the stuff like 5-10x faster and you don't end up binge-wasting your time.


I used to spend 12-15 hours per day looking at screen for YEARS, for the past half year I have managed to cut that to around 2hours per day- The best part, I manage to get #ben-productive{{MORE stuff done}} in those 2hours than I could ''do'' in 10 before that!

Crucial: #tech-out-of-sight{{After I have done the stuff I need to do, I place the laptop and phone in a drawer so I don't see them during the day}} and Don't have an urge to ''check stuff''.
