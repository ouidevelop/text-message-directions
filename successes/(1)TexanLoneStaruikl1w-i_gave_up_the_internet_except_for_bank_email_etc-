#yes #title:{{I gave up the internet (except for bank, email, etc. necessities, and they were only on my phone) for 45 days and my anxiety disorder / general mental health drastically improved, ending a 7 month long anxious wave.}} #permalink:/r/nosurf/comments/uikl1w/i_gave_up_the_internet_except_for_bank_email_etc/, #created:1651709863

#post{{I initially just wanted to do it as a spiritual thing for Lent, and get detached from the world. The first 2 weeks I didn't improve at all until I went cold turkey and #tech-remove-devices{{just had my room mate take my monitor to his office.}}

I wrote in the past [a post talking about how a lot of my anxious waves seem to stem from information I receive on the PC](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/tjg3cy/i_want_to_give_up_computer_forever_in_so_far_as/) and after 45 days I think I was right in my hypothesis that it was largely the computer's fault. 

#ben-less-anxiety{{Most of the things I worry about (looping intrusive thoughts) in that long list have died out}}. There is simply no more fuel to add to the fire.

No Surf definitely doesn't *improve* mental health in and of itself, in my experience, but it definitely *prevents* things from getting worse. All the while you have time to hammer out your real life problems. In my case I was constantly googling the optimal diets, supplements, exercises, etc. to try and solve my anxiety, unaware that this obsessive attempt to rid myself of what I have was an anxious behavior itself.

So the information overload stopped and things keep gradually allow themselves to get worked out. I think that's key: realizing that it doesn't heal mental health in and of itself as it does prevent a bunch of BS from getting stuck in your subconcious. I have no doubt that the information overload we see from the #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}} or #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}} frontpage has an enormous effects on our subconcious.


If you struggle with anxiety, looping intrustive thoughts, or depression I highly advise you simply go cold turkey and throw the PC monitor out and get Apple products or a filter to where only manually-entered sites are allowed.


#withdrawal-misc{{It is a brutal detox at first, and there were Sundays where I would just be staring at my wall, not wanting to read anymore}}, but it's worth it. You are neither escaping from reality, in my opinion. In regards to exposure therapy they say "What you resist persists" but I have found the total opposite after giving up computer: you are not resisting, you are simply returning your brain to the normal level of information-intake our ancestors have been receiving for thousands of years. Just like how humans are experiencing problems with modernity (sedentary life styles, etc.) I feel the overload of information is another big one.

Your life has enough things to worry about. If you struggle with anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues I really encourage you to go cold turkey. Real news pertaining to you, the *really* important stuff, will reach you no matter what.}}
