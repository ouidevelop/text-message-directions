#post{{I took a month off of social media recently. I still used #a-t-reddit{{reddit}} because I got news from here and I have a private sub I adore that I read every day and a few other subs for entertainment, but #tech-logout{{I didn't log into #a-t-twitter{{twitter}}, #a-t-instagram{{instagram}}, or #a-t-snapchat{{snapchat}}}} and #tech-delete{{deleted the apps}}. (I don't have facebook) I’m still getting my plan together on why my future relationship will look like with the internet and social media.

Anyway, I want to make a longer separate post about not having social media, but to sum it up, after my month was up I logged back in to say hi and see what was up.

- I missed the sandwich my friend had from a bakery that was apparently amazing. 
- I missed that some girl I've never met but somehow I follow on instagram is pregnant. 
- I missed photos of a party I wasn't invited to.
- I missed being bombarded by political news nonstop on twitter
- i missed a ton of photos of the snow when it started falling in my city (as it does literally every year...)
- I missed a bunch of sponsored posts of companies trying to sell me crap I don't need
I missed someone trying to sell their overpriced MLM makeup

- I didn't miss that my friend got an amazing new job because she texted me.
- I  didn't miss my friends' photos of their kids in halloween costumes because they emailed them me and I sent photos of my kids to the people that asked to see them.
- I didn't miss good memes because my husband texted them to me 
- I didn't miss invites from stuff I'd actually go to because people texted to let me know the info
- I didn't miss spending time with my kids with no distractions

I have a lot more I could write and will probably make a long post soon, but really... it's crazy how much just does NOT matter and how easy it is to #symp-wasted-time{{just waste time}}/brainpower away endlessly scrolling.

Also interesting to me how without social media I didn't feel like I used "the internet" a lot other than doing sensible stuff (putting library books on hold Etc) - without twitter and a ton of links of articles to read and falling into a wormhole of clicks it didn't seem like I was on the internet much. 

The people that are actually important and want to stay in contact did. Whenever #withdrawal-urges{{I had the overwhelming urge to log in just to "check" something}}, I would remind myself "it's the internet - it will probably be there forever so I don't need to see it now"}}
