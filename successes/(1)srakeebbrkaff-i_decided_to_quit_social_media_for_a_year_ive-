#post{{It was an impulsive move, but it has become one of the best decisions I have ever made.

10 years ago, I made my first #a-t-tumblr{{Tumblr}} account. I was 11 years old, and by the time I was 12 years old, I had already gained 22,000 followers. From a young age, I quickly learned what it meant to be a part of an online community. I hadn't realized it, but the amount of time that I had spent online was shaping my perception of the world around me. #symp-less-real-friends{{I never made an effort to befriend my classmates because I believed that no one would understand me the same way that my internet friends would}}. I met some of my internet friends at concerts and I exclusively interacted with them. It wasn't until college that I had experienced a shift in location, freedom, and routine and my screen time had been reduced for the friends I had been making real-time through my classes. Still, I had this lingering feeling that if I was not continuously posting pretty pictures of myself or funny content, then my followers would see no value in me—and this made me #symp-fear{{deeply uncomfortable and afraid}}.

In her book, #book-how-to-break-up-with-your-phone{{How To Break Up With Your Phone}}, Catherine Price emphasizes that our lives are what we pay attention to and if we spend our attention on our phone, then our phone will be our life. In my case, this is true. Halfway through my teenage years, I moved from Tumblr to other platforms such as #a-t-twitter{{Twitter}} and #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}} and I spent a lot of time figuring out how to curate a profile like the people I followed. #symp-living-for-online{{I was organizing my life based around what I could share online}}. I spent time thinking about new makeup looks, new clothes to buy, new photos to upload, new events I could attend—all so I can impress others and keep it consistent online. I took advantage of every new meme and new gossip about celebrities to create funny or relatable posts. #symp-risk-taking{{I even became more reckless and I did things I normally didn't do just so I could have a story to share online later}}. I have to admit, #symp-negative-self-image{{I wasn't proud of myself}}. Yet, this was all I ever knew about how to use the internet. Most of the users I befriended throughout my time online eventually reached between 20,000-100,000 followers. A few other ones surpassed a million. I wanted to stand out on the internet too.

A friend asked me to share my life story with him one day. It was then that I had realized that my life story revolved entirely around my history and engagement on the internet. I met so many people online who were a big part of my life. Although I have come across many beautiful and funny people online, I could tell that some of them weren't genuinely fulfilled with their lives and I wanted to be. If people are supposedly the average of the five people they spend the most time with, then I was the average of all the unhappy and misguided people that I followed online.

I'm really grateful that I quit. #ben-clear-mind{{My mind feels clear again}}. I'm unlearning what the internet has taught me about my self-image and my self-worth, and #ben-feel-better{{I have to say that it feels absolutely incredible to let go of it all}}.}}
