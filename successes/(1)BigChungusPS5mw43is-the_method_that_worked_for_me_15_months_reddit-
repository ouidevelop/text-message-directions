#post{{Hi All - I was reliant on Reddit and YouTube to distract me and numb my anxiety for about 5 years. The time I spent using them amounted to around 4 - 5 hours per day. When I was faced with an uncomfortable situation or realization, I would immediately bring up one of the two to dispel the tough feelings.

I wanted to give myself more time to think, about anything, rather than consume media during my spare time. I tried quitting countless times, and nothing ever stuck for more than a week.

I have been free of my Reddit and YouTube behavior for about 1.5 months, and have zero time spent using them on my phone with no desire to go back.

&amp;#x200B;

The Method is this:

#tech-blockers{{1. Download the Blocksite App}}
#tech-blockers{{2. Block all apps that allow for scrolling, unlimited content browsing as well as the browser versions.
3. Set a random nonsense password to access the Blocksite settings
4. Forget the random nonsense password}}
#tech-track-time{{5. Download the YourTime App, which tracks phone usage}}
6. Whitelist necessary apps like text, phone, and navigation
7. Use your time to monitor your usage, and gain an appreciation for your ability to avoid using whatever apps are distressing you.

I have found that I am not willing to reset the Blocksite password, and the password prompt reminds me to remain on task in addition to making it very difficult to access my time-waster apps. YourTime tracks usage data in a customizable format and gets me excited about breaking the habit.

#ben-more-time{{I am free to use my time as I wish rather than sitting in a black hole of content and media}}. I allow myself to watch YouTube on my TV and the interface is so clunky that it's difficult to get stuck in a rabbit hole of video-watching.

Let me know what you think!}}
