#post{{I’m happy to have found this subreddit! In the middle of last year I #tech-deactivate/delete-account{{deleted my Instagram}} after college. #symp-anxiety{{I felt anxious to post every week}} especially as my followers grew past the 2k mark it’s weird honestly to think of that many random people just “following” you to see your pictures. #symp-comparing{{And the whole “comparison is the thief of joy” phrase is REAL to say the least}}! I also found it odd when people I didn’t know dmed me.   Saying that I felt a lack of substance with the “friendships” I had on Instagram and Snapchat.

#ben-less-anxiety{{After deleting them I felt no anxiety}} or feelings of having to obsessively check my phone through the whole day, #ben-better-sleep{{and the lack of sleep because of the apps}}. #ben-productive{{I’m definitely more productive}}, and don’t have the urge to pick up my phone to use it while working or while hanging out with my family/friends. #symp-worse-social-life{{Also the apps caused issues in my romantics relationships on both ends}}. More so #a-t-snapchat{{Snapchat}} than Instagram.

A tip if you are thinking about deleting the apps I’d say to dm the ones you feel like are your friends your number and give them a heads up! Don’t be sad or upset if your connection/communication is not the same or as frequent with just texting/FaceTime. They simply were your acquaintance nothing more! Your real friends will be in contact with you like normal regardless if you have an Instagram or Snapchat!}}
