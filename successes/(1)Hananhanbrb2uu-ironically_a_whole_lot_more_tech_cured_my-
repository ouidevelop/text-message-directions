#post{{Just re joined reddit again today, I’m hoping it’s not a slippery slope. Over the past year i’ve dramatically decreased my time online (my problem was my phone) and I want to share how I did it.

A year ago I was easily spending 5 hours a day on my phone, maybe double that on the weekends. It was disgusting, #symp-feel-bad{{I was depressed, miserable}}, #withdrawal-bored{{bored}}, everything that most people probably feel when they’ve spent 3 hours straight lifelessly scrolling Facebook. #symp-misc{{I felt that my phone was sucking the life out of me}}. My phone actually gave me #symp-bad-health{{vision problems that I don’t believe I would have developed otherwise}}, I now have to wear glasses full time because of this. I don’t actually have a laptop or a desktop computer, that sense of the addiction never applied to me, so I can’t help in that department, but I did overcome my phone addiction and maybe I can help someone else with theirs.

These days I use the internet for probably between 0-30 minutes a day. On an average day probably about 10 minutes. Here’s what I did: #tech-smartwatch{{I bought an Apple Watch}}, #tech-misc{{iPad}} and #tech-tool-kindle{{a kindle}}. Yep, I know it’s ironic to overcome a tech addiction with 3x more tech but it really helped me. I went online and bought the #tech-downgrade{{oldest model of everything that would suit my requirements, and bought everything second hand}}. Then I #tech-downgrade{{downgraded my phone to a second hand iPhone 6}}. I didn’t even want to keep a bloody phone but I needed it to run the Apple Watch, I don’t even use it, #tech-put-devices-away{{it just sits in a drawer}}.

Then #tech-deactivate/delete-account{{I deleted EVERY social media account I had, permanently.}} #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}}, #a-t-snapchat{{snapchat}}, all of it. Never looked back. I am not the type of person who can handle stuff like that responsibly. The dopermine hits and the addiction is too much for me, even in small amounts I immediately get sucked back in. #withdrawal-time{{The first couple of days}} were #withdrawal-bored{{very strange and boring. It took a few days for my brain to click that I wasn’t going on Facebook anymore and to stop instinctively looking for my phone.}} But I don’t miss it. I am #ben-feel-better{{significantly happier}} and #ben-more-confident{{more confident in myself}} without it. #ben-better-social-life{{I actually enjoy spending time with my friends now}}, I don’t automatically find out every single thing about them as soon as it happens now. #ben-less-comparing{{I no longer compare everything about myself to others}} and I am much #ben-less-jealous{{less of a jealous person}}. Almost every area of my life has improved and I’d really recommend deleting that shite to anyone else.

Here’s how I used all the new devices to stop using my phone:

#tech-smartwatch{{Apple Watch: calls &amp; texts mostly.}} What a phone actually should be for, because I don’t take my phone around with me. Also for checking the time and the weather ect, things that I previously would have looked at my phone for, and then got sucked in to another hour on the internet afterwards. I actually don’t like taking calls or replying to texts off the watch, so sometimes I’ll wait until I get home to call people back from my real phone, but to be honest that feels really good. It’s nice to not be contactable at every second of the day. 99% of messages and calls can wait until I get home. I think for a lot of people, a dumb phone + iPad combo would work fine, this option worked for me as I like having it connected to the iPad and phone. A dumb phone would have probably worked fine, that’s just the option I chose.

Kindle: #other-activities-read{{reading}}, obviously. I found it a nice way to kind of get over cold turkey period of using a phone. Using a bit of technology with out the mid numbing uselessness.

#tech-misc{{iPad: I use this in exactly the same way I used my phone, minus the social media. Banking apps, maps, camera, internet, ect. The point is that it’s significantly less convenient to use than a phone.}} It’s small enough that I can take it out with me if I need it (I’m a girl, so carry a giant bag around anyway, no big deal to take an iPad around) but large enough that Im not just going to carry it about from room to room staring at it. I use it as my camera, so if I’m going somewhere I think I’d want to take photos I bring it along, or if I’d need a gps. But I’m not just going to pull it out every time I have a spare second to stare at it - this didn’t actually take much effort, it’s much less convenient and it just came naturally. At some point during the day I usually sit down and do things online like read through my emails, pay bills, look up things that have been on my mind ect, but the point is it’s intentional, and not immediate. I’m not opening and replying to emails the second I get them, then spending an hour on Facebook afterwards just because I opened my phone.

iPhone: just sits in a drawer. Use it occasionally to make phone calls still, but not often.

I still like to use the internet - but I now use it to benefit my new hobbies, not as my only hobby. #other-activities-productivity{{Ive actually started renovating my first home with my partner}} - all DIY, (this is why I’ve re-joined reddit) a year ago I couldn’t have imagined actually having a project to work on with my own hands, something to think about and have to use my brain over. Finding something like that feels so fulfilling compared to the empty “happiness” I got from my phone.}}
