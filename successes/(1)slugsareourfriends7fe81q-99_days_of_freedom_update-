#post{{Hello all! I had a fairly severe "wobble" earlier this week but have now regained at least some of my equilibrium. I've managed to stay away from #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}} and have joined the "99 Days of Freedom" project to give me that extra bit of accountability (and also to stop friends &amp; family worrying about my deactivation).

I'm managing to keep up with my goals for November &amp; December in the main, although I've fallen down a bit on the "do something creative every day" goal. #other-activities-writing{{Mostly I've been writing very short poems}} &amp; haikus.

I'm working on improving my terrible sleep patterns - it's not all my fault, to be fair - I have a stoma (ileostomy) that just loves to get active in the early hours of the morning which means I'm up wandering around the Web or watching TV at 2 am most nights. It's having a terrible effect on my mood &amp; if I'm tired I have a lot less willpower. I am experimenting with changing my eating patterns though, to see if I can improve this.

Wish me luck!}}
