#post{{#withdrawal-time{{The first 2 weeks}} of quitting #withdrawal-sick{{I felt physically sick}}. It felt like was quitting a drug.. How do people live without this? Are people not #withdrawal-bored{{bored}}? I’m doing something cool today. I’m wasting money because no one is seeing this! Ugh. I wonder what xyz is up to #withdrawal-misc-social{{their life was interesting to watch I must see}}!”.

But then I had to ask myself the most important question: Why? Why exactly am I still on here? Am I posting just so my exes can see how good I’m doing now. So people can see how cool my life is. So people can see that I’m important. I need to see other’s lives so I can be just like that and/or top that. I need to be in the loop and aware of what’s going on of celebs etc etc.. 
Then I realized.. all of my “whys” Came from lack. It came from a place of 0 self confidence and fueling my ego.


I just wish you guys knew. My screen time used to average 10 hours a day. I had #symp-misc{{no hobbies}}. I was #symp-bad-socially{{terrible socially}}. #symp-less-money{{I’m ashamed on how much I spent on clothes and other things to impress others}}. I let opinions from social media influence some terrible choices. #symp-comparing{{It made me jealous}}, #symp-anxiety{{anxious and all of the above}}. But most importantly, #symp-wasted-time{{I lost time}}. I lost myself. #symp-less-clean{{My room was a mess}}, #symp-less-exercise{{I never had time to work out}} or eat regularly. #symp-worse-social-life{{I ignored my family}}. #symp-less-responsible{{I would run late to work}}. #symp-living-for-online{{I was always stuck in my mind. Always thinking of whats next? What can I post next? What can I do so everyone could be in awe of me? I was never in the now, just an absent brainless zombie.}} And you could tell.

So I quit. Social media did nothing for me but TAKE. 4 years of my life, way too long you have to go! #tech-delete{{I deleted all apps}}. All. I was sick and tired of being sick and tired. As stated.  The first 2 weeks was horrible, #tech-review-motivations{{but sticking to my “why” is what saved me.}}

Here we are 2 months later and wow, if you haven’t stopped you are missing out!!!!!!!!!!! #ben-feel-better{{I’m smiling more}}, #ben-better-looks{{my skin is brighter}}, #ben-misc{{I’m manifesting better things in my life}}, #other-activities-friends-and-family{{I’m around family}}, #other-activities-exercise{{I’m working out}}, eating better, getting into different interest. #ben-being-present{{I’m more present in conversations and everything}}! #ben-less-anxiety{{No more anxiety on if my crush saw my story, or if I got enough likes.}} #ben-saved-money{{I don’t have to spend money on being dolled up 24/7 for the media. }}

#ben-freedom{{I feel FREE.}} Free is the word to describe it. I feel normal! #ben-more-time{{I have much more time these days!}} Please just give it 2 months you guys please!!!!!

Also, just to add I logged back in #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}} for the first time today just to see how I’d feel.. and let me tell you I just laughed. I felt so sorry for the ones who stories are so long. Still needing their egos filled. All these outrageous photos people still post. The commentary and arguments over celebs. I can’t believe people still waste their times. I quickly logged out. I felt so off being on there. I can’t believe people think it’s important or real life. After a while you start questioning what’s so special??? But hey then again that was once me.

Disclaimer: I’m not saying anything is wrong with social media. You just need to have a control over it. I have a control over it to the point where I can make 1 post every 3 months, ghost it and be content. 

Also if you’re a were a huge addict like me, it may be difficult to totally put down your phone. Start with baby steps. Start with deleting social media and then from there slowly decrease YouTube, Reddit, and google usage. For me I still use #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}} and #a-t-search{{google}} A LOT so my next 2 month goal is to stop those as well and I’ll come back with another update!

Good luck and delete those apps!!}}
