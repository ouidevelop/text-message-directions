#post{{I #tech-deactivate/delete-account{{deleted social media}} due to many rumors being spread about me. I was a very ego-dominated person who (without realizing consciously) would #symp-approval-seeking{{constantly seek approval by my achievements, looks, and creations}}. I had a good thing going, until I got what was coming: if you care too much about the good opinions of others, then you'll get hit hard by the bad opinions. #symp-less-self-controll{{I felt very out of control}} and I saw my ego for what it was. After deleting all my socials, #ben-freedom{{I felt so free}}. #ben-live-in-reality{{As if I unplugged from a sort of matrix and was experiencing what a real social life was}}. I lived alone, so I would call my friends and have them over and catch up and talk face to face. #ben-less-comparing{{I was no longer comparing myself with others}}. Like time had stopped when I was home. I could do whatever I wanted and I was not in a hurry to catch up with the rest of the world. #ben-more-time{{I have more time}}, #ben-better-attention{{more focus}}, and #ben-more-creative{{I am much more creative}}. Looking back, social media is a very toxic environment that promotes separation and competition (whether it be conscious or not). I hope my little story here can maybe give you motivation to scroll less at the very least and live real life! I made a video discussing what I've learned in more detail. Thanks!
