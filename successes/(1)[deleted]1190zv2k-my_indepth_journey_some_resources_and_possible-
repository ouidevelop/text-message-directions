#post{{Years ago, I came across a book by Neil Postman called *#book{{Amusing Ourselves to Death}}* (1985) and it changed my life. I'm sure there are some fellow travelers here or have seen the popular comic, but it radically changed my perspective on television.  Unfortunately Postman passed away before the internet as we knew it came to be but had incredibly prescient thoughts on our current state of affairs.

I had to read his book *#book{{Technopoly}}* (1992) and it was able to articulate a lot of what I had seemingly sensed.  There are a few quotes I'd like to share and highly recommend this book if you need a starting foundation and justification to continue/start your own NoSurf journey...

&gt; "Technopoly is a state of culture. It is also a state of mind. It consists in the deification of technology, which means that the culture seeks its authorization in technology, finds its satisfactions in technology, and takes its orders from technology."

&gt; "One characteristic of those who live in a Technopoly is that they are largely unaware of both the origins and the effects of their technologies."

&gt; "Technological change is neither additive nor subtractive. It is ecological. I mean “ecological” in the same sense as the word is used by environmental scientists. One significant change generates total change. If you remove the caterpillars from a given habitat, you are not left with the same environment minus caterpillars: you have a new environment, and you have reconstituted the conditions of survival; the same is true if you add caterpillars to an environment that has had none. This is how the ecology of media works as well. A new technology does not add or subtract something. It changes everything."

&gt; "From millions of sources all over the globe, through every possible channel and medium—light waves, airwaves, ticker tapes, computer banks, telephone wires, television cables, satellites, printing presses—information pours in. Behind it, in every imaginable form of storage—on paper, on video and audio tape, on discs, film, and silicon chips—is an ever greater volume of information waiting to be retrieved. Like the Sorcerer’s Apprentice, we are awash in information. And all the sorcerer has left us is a broom. Information has become a form of garbage, not only incapable of answering the most fundamental human questions but barely useful in providing coherent direction to the solution of even mundane problems. To say it still another way: The milieu in which Technopoly flourishes is one in which the tie between information and human purpose has been severed, i.e., information appears indiscriminately, directed at no one in particular, in enormous volume and at high speeds, and disconnected from theory, meaning, or purpose."

&gt; "Technocracy gave us the idea of progress, and of necessity loosened our bonds with tradition—whether political or spiritual. Technocracy filled the air with the promise of new freedoms and new forms of social organization. Technocracy also speeded up the world. We could get places faster, do things faster, accomplish more in a shorter time. Time, in fact, became an adversary over which technology could triumph. And this meant that there was no time to look back or to contemplate what was being lost."

&gt; "A peek-a-boo world, where now this event, now that, pops into view for a moment, then vanishes again. It is an improbable world. It is a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress. The aim is not to reduce ignorance, superstition, and suffering but to **accommodate ourselves to the requirements of new technologies.** We tell ourselves, of course, that such accommodations will lead to a better life, but that is only the rhetorical residue of a vanishing technocracy. We are a culture consuming itself with information, and many of us do not even wonder how to control the process. We proceed under the assumption that information is our friend, believing that cultures may suffer grievously from a lack of information, which, of course, they do. It is only now beginning to be understood that cultures may also suffer grievously from information glut, information without meaning, information without control mechanisms."

&gt; "When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience, and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; culture-death is a clear possibility.” 

&gt; "We no longer talk to each other, we entertain each other. we do not exchange ideas, we exchange images. we do not argue with propositions; we argue with good looks, celebrities and commercials.

&gt; "Everything in our background has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse dissolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture's being drained by laughter?”

These words struck my eyes and pierced my soul so deeply that I had could no longer look at social media or the internet itself the same. It was a radical reorientation of thought and priority. I looked at how I used #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}} and #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}} and it didn't make sense anymore. I was never an adopter of Snapchat, Vine, Tinder, etc. but I was absolutely shocked at how widespread and popular they were within my immediate social circle. I remembered reading an old book from the sixties, #book{{*Society of the Spectacle*}} and how apropos these theses were:

&gt; In societies where modern conditions of production prevail, all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles. Everything that was directly lived has moved away into a representation.

&gt; The images detached from every aspect of life fuse in a common stream in which the unity of this life can no longer be reestablished. Reality considered partially unfolds, in its own general unity, as a pseudo-world apart, an object of mere contemplation. The specialization of images of the world is completed in the world of the autonomous image, where the liar has lied to himself. The spectacle in general, as the concrete inversion of life, is the autonomous movement of the non-living.

&gt; The images detached from every aspect of life fuse in a common stream in which the unity of this life can no longer be reestablished. Reality considered partially unfolds, in its own general unity, as a pseudo-world apart, an object of mere contemplation. The specialization of images of the world is completed in the world of the autonomous image, where the liar has lied to himself. The spectacle in general, as the concrete inversion of life, is the autonomous movement of the non-living.

&gt; The spectacle presents itself simultaneously as all of society, as part of society, and as instrument of unification. As a part of society it is specifically the sector which concentrates all gazing and all consciousness. Due to the very fact that this sector is separate, it is the common ground of the deceived gaze and of false consciousness, and the unification it achieves is nothing but an official language of generalized separation.

&gt; **The spectacle is not a collection of images, but a social relation among people, mediated by images.**

&gt; The first phase of the domination of the economy over social life brought into the definition of all human realization the obvious degradation of being into having. The present phase of total occupation of social life by the accumulated results of the economy leads to a generalized sliding of having into appearing, from which all actual “having” must draw its immediate prestige and its ultimate function. At the same time all individual reality has become social reality directly dependent on social power and shaped by it. It is allowed to appear only to the extent that it is not.

&gt; Where the real world changes into simple images, the simple images become real beings and effective motivations of hypnotic behavior. The spectacle, as a tendency to make one see the world by means of various specialized mediations (it can no longer be grasped directly), naturally finds vision to be the privileged human sense which the sense of touch was for other epochs; the most abstract, the most mystifiable sense corresponds to the generalized abstraction of present-day society. But the spectacle is not identifiable with mere gazing, even combined with hearing. It is that which escapes the activity of men, that which escapes reconsideration and correction by their work. It is the opposite of dialogue. Wherever there is independent representation, the spectacle reconstitutes itself.

&gt; The technology is based on isolation, and the technical process isolates in turn. From the automobile to television, all the goods selected by the spectacular system are also its weapons for a constant reinforcement of the conditions of isolation of “lonely crowds.” The spectacle constantly rediscovers its own assumptions more concretely.

Social media immediately felt disgusting to me.

I had thought about the certain behaviors and symptoms which I had seemed to develop from social media and consistent use of the internet. #tech-journaling{{I decided to journal and keep track of what I felt}}... #symp-worse-concentration{{I felt scattered}}, #symp-worse-concentration{{distracted}}, #symp-misc{{impulsive}}, a constant need for stimulation... #symp-worse-concentration{{I was unable to focus}}, I would drift in and out of conversations, I would check my phone which seemed incessantly, as soon as I awoke and right before I fell asleep. #symp-misc{{A sense of disorientation swept over me}}, as if I had slowly been molded or changed into someone new.

Then I found *#book-the-shallows{{The Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains}}* by Nicholas Carr. It provided the neuroscience of what was happening. It discussed how platforms operate, how they are designed to encourage addiction or undermine human psychology.

I had come to the conclusion that I had to minimize or completely cut out entire platforms and mediums. But first, what was I even using them for? I told myself Facebook was to keep in touch with people, or follow local community groups. That #a-t-twitter{{Twitter}} was for news.

I decided to quit Twitter. It didn't make much sense to me anymore. Why was rapid dissemination of information so necessary? How often was it wrong? How often has it been in jest or froth? I watched the platform turn journalists, scientists and pundits into ironic shitposters delivering their own hot takes in a sea of irreverence. I don't wake up and infinitely scroll for a few hours before I start my day anymore, finding a link and clicking another link...

But what do I do to be informed? #tech-do-other-things{{I learned that discounted subscriptions to print newspapers and magazines}} really aren't much more or even cheaper than the #a-t-tv-and-movies{{Netflix}}, #a-t-tv-and-movies{{Hulu}}, #a-t-tv-and-movies{{HBO}} and #a-t-shopping{{Amazon}} I was paying for. #tech-deactivate/delete-account{{I cancelled them}} and now I wake up (a whole lot earlier now that #ben-better-sleep{{I sleep better!)}} to a newspaper and come home to a new magazine. Print really helps concentration, critical thinking, reflection and retention.  I use the library more now than I have ever in my life. If you're fortunate to have one, utilize it. Magazines, newspapers, books, movies, and community groups are right there, paid for by you and that community. I can request any book and go pick it up that day or have it shipped and pick it up within 2-3 days. Way cheaper than Amazon too!

I decided to quit Facebook. Every one I needed to talk to was easily reachable and community groups organize, e-mail snail mail and advertise elsewhere. It stopped making sense.

#withdrawal-fomo{{That fleeting sense of "FOMO" people say they develop did happen, but it disappears pretty quick}} when you have a foundation to understand and justify your thoughts and behaviors. Embarking on #ben-more-intentional{{NoSurf revealed a different person in myself... A person who acted and spoke deliberately}}, one who had rediscovered #ben-more-patient{{patience}}, #ben-better-attention{{concentration}}, #ben-contemplation{{contemplation}}, the ability to be alone with my thoughts. Conversation began to feel "real", #ben-more-time{{time moves much slower}}. #ben-notice-more{{I feel more aware of my surroundings}} #ben-appreciate-more{{and have a new found appreciation for them.}} An odd insect or a good meal doesn't instinctively make me reach towards my pocket to document this experience for the world.

The reality I thought existed online wasn't really much more than our immediate reactions to it.. Everything I thought I needed the internet for wasn't so true. So many conveniences saved so much time, but that the time saved was less lived. 

I'm embarking on TL;DR territory so... here are a few recommendations aside from those already posted: 

* *#book{{Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other}}* by Sherry Turkle
* *#book{{The Glass Cage: How Our Computers are Changing Us}}* by Nicholas Carr
* *#book{{Ten Arguments To Delete Your Social Media Accounts Right Now}}* by Jaron Lanier
* *#book{{Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business Keeping us Hooked}}* by Adam Alter
* *#book{{The Attention Merchants}}* by Tim Wu
* *#book{{The World Beyond Your Head: On Becoming an Individual in an Age of Distraction}}* by Matthew Crawford
* *#book{{Present Shock}}* by Douglass Rushkoff
* *#book{{Stand Out of Our Light: Freedom in the Attention Economy}}* by James Williams.

I can post more if anyone has specific interests but feel free to ask questions and share your journey. I'm interested in yours. I know the obvious irony here but I'm the feudal lord who once owned the pitchforks his peasants used to overthrow him observed the irony just as well...
