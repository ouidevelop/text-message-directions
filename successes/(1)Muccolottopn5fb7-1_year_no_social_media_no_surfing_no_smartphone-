#post{{Hello my amateur addicted friends, are you ready for a story? Here is mine!

I dont know exactly but i think im in the internet since i was 4 years old. My father is an engineer, he created e-mail accounts for me and my older brother. We had slowest internet connection in our country(Turkey). When i was 6 years old, i could read and write influently and my internet addiction started lol. I think i was excluded from my primary school and neighbourhood for i was too stupid to make friends, everybody was mocking me i remembered :D So i created my #a-t-facebook{{facebook}} account in 2008, and making online friends to make fun with them. I was talking a lot of strangers and having fun for a while, creating jokes for them, searching for jokes all the time.

Then #a-t-youtube{{youtube}} came in my life, then #a-t-twitter{{twitter}}, #a-t-instagram{{instagram}}, #a-t-reddit{{reddit}}, gaming meseengers, #a-t-games{{games}} etc. It was a shitty life that i was spending 10+ hours on my phone.

I dont know man but i think my ego is huge, i was thinking i was the smartest person in the world :) and all the influencers, youtubers, famous people etc started to become stupids in my op. ALways thought "Why i am watching this stupid?" "Why i am making him/her richer ", "Why i am using this apps/websites for" "why all my friends are sharing themselves like they are cool and smart person while they have shitty life?", "Why all of my friends are stupid?", "why i dont have any solid friends in my life " etc etc. So i decided to change my life forever.

Let see, i was masturbating 3 times a day, 10 hours of surfing, #symp-gaining-weight{{getting fatter(like a barrel)}}, #symp-worse-school{{my gpa was getting lower}}, #symp-worse-concentration{{my concentration is gone}}, smoking 1 pack per day, drink alcohol with no money :/

So, i've gone cold turkey, i've quitted all of these bad habits LIKE A FUCKING CHAMPION! And guess what? 

I couldnt quit social media man, dude wtf how it could be more addictive than cigarettes or coffee or #a-t-porn{{PORN}}??

Yeah thats right, even i quit sugar and go diet keto, with all that willpower, i couldnt do it man, so i started to search on internet. I found some shitty books like contains "7 ways to reduce social media" "You are better than this", "wake up early, drink water, read books " stuff. Then found Dopamine hormon makes my life shittier. WHile searching it, i make a list of must have apps to me. I mean must have to live like a civilized human being. As a student whatsapp important to keep in touch of college, google maps is important too, music apps, gmail and thats it to me. If  i could find a phone can cover these, want to switch to it. I literally write google "Dumbphone with whatsapp" and found some shitty phones. But i want wifi, bluetooth, 4g etc to able to get/send messages or mails. God i found Kaios phones. 

#tech-dumbphone{{Kaios is a half-smartphone operating system}}. If a smartphone's iq is 150, then kaios is 75. It is like Kramer in Seinfeld. It has an appstore itself which has whatsapp, gmail, maps, and music app and lots of app but in dumber ways with physical keyboards(idk what u americans called it but it has real keyboard u can push buttons to write like oldschool.) I loved it and found 2nd hand in a website like craiglist for 20 dollars xD. Then i gave my phone to my miserable father who was trying surf in iphone 4 :D. At first, it was hard to maintain my dopamine, and banking apps or food delivery apps were useful to me too, but i migrate them to my laptop.

Now, I am using for 1 years this dumb Kaios phone,  added my #tech-blockers{{laptop website blocker to block social media}}, never used them again.

Before and after psychological analysis: 

My mind is expandind dude, I always thought without youtube, i cant learn new things but #other-activities-learn{{i bought books for learning, i've learned  flutter, dart, c, python, english, spanish(basic) and trying to make a new career.}}

#ben-better-attention{{Concentration is fucking awesome, i always thought i had ADHD but no man, It is all fucking websites to focus you on their contents}}. I couldnt read a book for years, but now i am reading 150 pages per day(all novels and stories)

#ben-more-time{{I have hours to}} #other-activities-go-out{{go out}}, #other-activities-learn{{learn}}, #other-activities-exercise{{do sport}}, #other-activities-read{{read}}, #other-activities-learn{{study}} and having fun. I didnt learn any instruments in my life for what? What a life means without joy?

I read sometimes here and some peoples saying this is the last, upvote and im gone, i dont think other people can help your issues dude, its all your job. You've shitted your life, you should clean it. 

Some of you write, you dont have friends who are not addicted, i think there are some accountability programs on the net, you can go there. 

Last but not the least, do you think other peoples opinions and lifes are important enough to be rewarded by your priceless time?}}
