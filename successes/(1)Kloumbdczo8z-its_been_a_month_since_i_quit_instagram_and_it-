#post{{I’m in high school and it feels like practically everyone has #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}}. I decided to quit all social media that connected me to others. I have #a-t-reddit{{reddit}}, #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}}, #a-t-snapchat{{Snapchat}}, and #a-t-vsco{{VSCO}}. All of them are under anonymous accounts so nobody I know can follow me or know who I am. This is great because I feel like I can post and I’m not just doing it for other people to like me. There were a lot more reasons I wanted to quit.

#symp-approval-seeking{{I was constantly seeking validation and approval from others}}. #symp-comparing{{I always compared myself and it felt like somehow everyone was better than me}}. #symp-living-for-online{{I would go places just to take pictures and ruin every moment just trying to make a great post}}. I hated it, I didn’t know it at the time. #ben-stopped-living-for-the-internet{{But now I can just take a picture and just enjoy the memory instead of thinking of a good caption or thinking about how many likes I would get for it.}}

Even at school, people knew you through social media. If you only had about 100 followers, you were automatically unpopular. It felt I was living my life for people I didn’t even know. I would take it personally if people unfollowed me or didn’t like my posts. #symp-wasted-time{{I spent hours and hours of my day scrolling through the same videos}} on Instagram. It was so unhealthy and I had no idea.

It was only until I temporarily #tech-deactivate/delete-account{{deleted my account}} for a week in the summer that I noticed. Nobody texted me to ask what happened. Nobody even noticed at all. I didn’t miss scrolling through posts, I didn’t ever feel like I was missing out. The final turning point was when I was obsessively checking my ex-boyfriend’s profile every day. I couldn’t stop. I decided, if I deleted Instagram I would stop and nothing in my life would even change. So I did.

I finally saw who was really my friend. I still had iMessage and I still saw a lot of the same people every day. But it made me realize that the people who liked my pictures didn’t really care about my life and the things that I thought mattered don’t mean anything. But #ben-feel-better{{I feel so much better now}}. I went from spending 5-6 hours on my phone to spending 2-3 hours every day. I don’t feel like I’m missing out, in fact #ben-misc{{I’m making so many more meaningful memories now}}.}}
