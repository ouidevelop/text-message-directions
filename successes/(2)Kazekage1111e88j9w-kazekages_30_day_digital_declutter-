#post{{TLDR — I started Cal Newport's 30-day digital declutter challenge on the 1 December 2019. During this period, optional digital technology usage was dramatically reduced, productivity skyrocketed and the beginnings of new hobbies developed despite some unexpected challenges.

# Why?

So, why bother starting a *Digital Declutter*?

Addiction.

My past behavior with *optional digital technologies* would, in my estimation, comfortably fit this definition of addiction - *“continued use despite harmful consequences”.*

I was addicted to:

* #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}} (worst offender)
* #a-t-twitter{{Twitter}}
* #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}}
* #a-t-tv-and-movies{{Netflix}}
* To a lesser extent, #a-t-games{{video games}} and #a-t-facebook{{Fakebook}}.

To paint a picture:

* I watched YouTube 3-5 hrs daily. The same or more on the weekends.
* Spent 10 hrs per week on video games, more if I was hooked on a specific game.
* On waking up, 30-90 mins wasted scrolling through Reddit and Facebook. Sometimes YouTube.
* Phone scrolling in the restrooms both at home and job
* Phone scrolling while eating
* Phone scrolling/watching YouTube during lunch

It hadn’t occurred to me before that I was an addict despite how seemingly obvious it now appears after listing my behavior. Food, drugs, gambling, to list a few, always seemed clear examples of addiction; but not looking at screens too much... 

In retrospect, the behaviors were invisible yet constant and in the interests of tough-love: #symp-misc{{destructive}}, #symp-wasted-time{{time wasting}}, #symp-guilt{{guilt-ridden}} and mindless.

I've heard that addictions always serve some useful purpose(s).. **If that’s true, my ‘purpose’, if I had to guess, for looking at screens so much was to remain ‘comfortable’ i.e. to avoid confronting emotionally difficult challenges**. You may have noticed I tentatively used the term ‘comfortable’. Reason? There is only so ‘comfortable' one can be when many of your life goals are persistently thwarted/delayed in the interest of spending time being entertained by screens.

So, how did I find out about the Digital Declutter?

I became a fan of Cal Newport after reading his book titled *Deep Work*. When I heard he was soon releasing a book about *#book-digital-minimalism{{Digital Minimalism}}*, I was disappointed. The subject matter seemed, to my mind at the time, unimportant and a waste of his talent. But as I discovered soon enough, I was wrong.

Fast forward to late November 2019, I was struggling, as usual, to get personal projects done. Why? Well… you probably guessed it; addiction-like behavior towards optional digital technologies. And I was SICK of it. Like a tonne of bricks it hit me *“Time spent obsessively staring at screens for entertainment/infotainment was ruining my life!!”*. 

Fortunately, soon after realizing this, I recalled purchasing *Digital Minimalism*  and immediately started reading up to Part 2 titled *Digital Declutter*.

# Purpose of the Digital Declutter

The purpose of the 30-Day Digital Declutter, to paraphrase Cal Newport, is to reset one’s digital life through the removal (or near removal) of *optional technologies* for 30 days. #tech-do-other-things{{During this period we are to make use of the void these technologies previously filled to discover/rediscover those activities and interests that we find intrinsically meaningful and satisfying}}. Moreover, Cal asserts that we want to reach a place where usage of these optional technologies are in support of our core values, not in opposition to them.

# Operating Procedures

Using guidance from the book, I concocted the following  *operating procedures* for the challenge;

&amp;#x200B;

|Platform|Service|Access Level|Reason|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|iOS|E-mail|Ban|There is never an e-mail I receive on my iPhone that is so critically important that I cannot wait until I get back home to use my Macbook. Therefore, it’s presence only served as a distraction.|
||Twitter|Ban|I’d use this mindless in the mornings on waking up but also unconsciously look for updates many times daily despite nothing important ever happening on the service that would necessitate the level of effort I was using to keep on top of it.  |
||Netflix|Ban|Rarely used the app on iPad/iPhone but banned it anyway in case I was tempted to use it now my other sources of getting my screen fix were banned.  |
||Reddit|Ban|Same as Twitter.|
|||Ban|Typically used the app on iPhone during lunch for 30 or so mins or when eating dinner at home. Another mindless activity, so banned it.  |
|MacOS|E-mail||No point in restricting; I don’t receive many important e-mails daily. When I do and need to respond, I don’t want to be limited to X amount of minutes per day.  |
||Reddit||25 mins daily - limited using ColdTurkey app. Needed website for research purposes when working on personal projects and/or studying.  |
||YouTube||25 mins daily - limited using ColdTurkey app. Gives me a little screen fix per day for fun and alleviates the fear of missing out. Furthermore, it forces you to prioritize what is watched rather than watching everything because you can. Massive restriction here when compared to typical daily YouTube usage.  |
||Facebook||5 mins daily - limited using ColdTurkey app. Just enough time to quickly see if anything important happens (never does!).  |
||Twitter||5 mins daily - limited using ColdTurkey app. Just enough time to quickly see if anything important happens.  |
|Windows|Gaming|Ban|I use this PC only for gaming. So no gaming was allowed for this challenge.  |

*\*Please excuse the poor the columns being too wide for the first three columns, I cannot figure out how to adjust them.\**

In order to limit those services on my Mac, I used a piece of software called #tech-blocker-cold-turkey{{ColdTurkey}} (also available on Windows).#tech-time-limits{{ One of it’s features gives the user the ability to restrict certain apps/websites for X amount of minutes per day, for a given period}} (like a day, week, month etc) and during this restriction the user is prevented from getting around it by disabling or uninstalling it i.e. your stuck with it.

# Results

In this section, I will detail how I got on with each service listed in the above table.

|Service|iOS|Mac|
|:-|:-|:-|
|  E-mail  |  No problem whatsoever with e-mail being banned from the iPhone. I never felt I needed to check it as I knew that once I got home I could check it.  |  Due to Airmail’s badge icons, I would not miss a day not checking e-mails. I’d review them, triage and action where necessary making sure to reach inbox zero most days.  |
|Twitter|#withdrawal-urges{{At the beginning of the challenge, I’d frequently be checking for this on my iPhone whenever I’d be in the restroom, eating or during any downtime}}. Luckily, I had uninstalled the Twitter app (Tweetbot) and so couldn’t follow through on the impulse. The FOMO was not there as I knew I could use it for 5mins at home once I got on my Mac).           As the month progressed, I grew less and less interested in the service and eventually did not feel the need to check it at all.|I used the official Twitter app for this service and limited myself to 5 mins per day. It quickly became apparent this was not enough time to check my timeline and read tweet comments due to the number of people/businesses followed. In response, #tech-unsubscribe{{I unsubscribed from around half of those I derived barely any benefit from}} which significantly helped.                                                  As the month progressed, I grew less and less interested in the service and eventually did not feel the need to check it at all. #tech-delete{{Eventually, **I deleted the app from my computer}} and #tech-deactivate/delete-account{{deactivated Twitter}}** as I could get the same information elsewhere, in more detail, without having to read through the ‘cruft’ tweets in-between those that were ‘valuable’. |
|NetFlix|No problem with not using this service on iPhone. Rarely used it on this platform so didn’t feel I was missing out.  | I was really good. I only watched *The Witcher* during the month. Less than 10 hours in 30 days, in my opinion, was a win.|
#withdrawal-urges{{|Reddit| Same as Twitter, I fiended for this service at first}} but grew increasingly disenchanted by it. Towards the end of the month, however, the desire to use it popped its head up every now and then and so I’d unconsciously find myself quickly scrolling through Reddit’s mobile website for a fix. This unconscious behavior was disturbing; that I could do something without knowing. To add in consciousness to the activity, I had placed a #tech-blockers{{Screen Time restriction for it to prompt me that I shouldn’t be using the site}}. This helped.|The 25mins daily allowance was sufficient.  I rarely needed it more than this amount and it prevented mindless scrolling as I didn’t want to squander the allowance in case I needed it for something important later the same day. On some days, I didn’t scroll through it at all.|
|YouTube|No problem with not using this service on iPhone.  |This was odd.                                    Due to the 25min daily allowance, it became immediately apparent that I was drinking from a fire hose and had too little time to drink. Therefore, each day, I quickly scanned through my recommendations and subscriptions and had to decide what I could watch within my short time frame and make the most of it. The allowance also eliminated FOMO.                            This process added the required intentionality to realize that most of what I was subscribed to may have been fun or informative, but far from necessary.                                  YouTube videos can be informative, but most times, for me, too shallow to really feel informed on a topic.|
|Facebook|No problem with not using this service on iPhone.  Never been a Facebook fan and I knew I could check its status at home and there was never been a time I’ve urgently and immediately had to respond or comment/like something.|5 mins per day was more than enough...                                       During the month, I kept thinking *“Do I really need this? Should I just deactivate it like Twitter”?*                                                          If it wasn’t for the fact that I'm in some private groups I’d delete it today. Even then, I’m still considering it.                                                           My real friends send messages/call, it’s only acquaintances that I’m really tracking on Facebook and there is only so many memes, virtue signalling, baby pics and outrage posts I can tolerate.|

In terms of gaming, I did not spend a single minute gaming during the challenge. #bad-bored{{There was times I missed this hobby}}, but it was manageable.

# What went well

1. *Productivity* \- #ben-productive{{On weekdays, after work, I had 6 hours spare time and on the weekend, 16 hours}}. When faced with such a huge void of time ahead of me, and unable to fill it with optional digital technologies, it backs one into a corner. Despite being a recovering chronic procrastinator, I found myself reading and spending lots of time working on personal projects which I would not have done pre-challenge. #ben-productive{{I’m still in shock on how much I got done.}}
2. *Sleep* \- #ben-better-sleep{{My sleep improved considerably}} for mainly two reasons. (1) As I was restricted from mindless digital scrolling/gaming, I typically had no reason to stay up too late and found myself going to be at the right time each night to get 7.5-8 hrs of sleep. (2) The aforementioned productivity increase reduced the stress of open to-do loops i.e. had less to worry about.
3. *#ben-better-social-life{{Spent more time with Family}}* \- - I live with my Mum and Nan. Pre-challenge, I’d spend most my time in my bedroom except for when I need to make something to eat or leaving/entering the home. With all the spare time made available, I found myself craving stimulation and spending more time speaking to them. The only downside, is that sometimes they’d be watching TV and despite not being at TV watcher at all, I’d find myself unconsciously (forgetting I was on a challenge) sitting down for a hour or so, now and then , watching it with them.
4. *Mornings* \- No more wasting 30-90mins daily scrolling Reddit and Twitter.
5. *More Frequent walks -* #other-activities-walk{{I’d go on 2-3 walks per day}}. Before, it was once per day. I’d walk in solitude as Cal would describe it, and so no music, podcasts, audiobooks etc. Just myself with my thoughts. Tip: If you have an apple watch, use Drafts to record any insights, tasks etc you’d like to remember.
6. *Daily journalling* \- #other-activities-journal{{I logged my progress daily and posted it on Reddit}}. I enjoyed the process and provided insights I would not have gained otherwise if I hadn’t.
7. *Hobby* \- #other-activities-exercise{{signed up for an introduction to CrossFit}} and #other-activities-misc{{Clay Pigeon Shooting}}. Enjoyed them both and looking forward to participate in them going forward.

# What did not go well

1. *The Void* \- I underestimated how much time I had to fill once the mindless digital usage was culled. #withdrawal-bored{{I often found myself bored}} and pottering around the house or going on walks because I had nothing else to do. Yes, I could have spent time on my personal projects, however, I can’t (or at least don’t want to) work all the time. This led to #withdrawal-difficult-thoughts-and-feelings{{lots of painful memories and past regrets to be dominant}} #withdrawal-time{{mostly during the first couple of weeks}}, #ben-work-through-tough-thoughts{{but once worked through and reconciled, I feel much better than I did pre-challenge}}. This is still a WIP and I’m still looking for more things to do that are fun and frequent which don’t involve screens.
2. *Anime* \- I had the stupid thought that seeing as I had been working so hard it wouldn’t matter if I watched a few anime episodes. BIG MISTAKE. I ended up finishing 4 anime series (Dr. Stone, Black Clover, Demon Slayer, Cautious Hero). Even though the time spent on these was a drop in the ocean considering how many hours are in a month, it still defeats some of the purpose with the challenge to begin with. Once I started, I was hooked. I did not predict this would happen before I started the challenge and so had no operating procedure to mitigate it.

# Conclusion

Going forward, I’m going to stick with Digital Minimalism. Sadly in today’s age it’s a superpower. Imagine that, just not being a typical screen zombie can get you ahead..The changes I’d now make based on my experiences with this challenge are:

1. Allow YouTube, video games, anime &amp; Netflix for Sundays after 2pm only. None of these are allowed any other day of the week. This will give me something to look forward to after a productive week and allow for more *Deep Work* between Monday to Saturday. It will also mitigate the aforementioned anime issue and reintroduce the hobby I enjoy the most, gaming.
2. Schedule in non-screen leisure on a calendar to fill the void.
3. Find a craft I want to do, just to do it

Except for the Anime watching, I felt the challenge was a success. #ben-misc{{My days are less of a blur and more meaningful}}. #ben-feel-better{{In general, I’m happier}}. 

It was well worth doing and if think the you fit the above definition of an addict I’d recommend you this Digital Declutter challenge a try, it’s only for 30 days.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. If you have any questions, ask them below and I’ll respond as soon as possible.}}
