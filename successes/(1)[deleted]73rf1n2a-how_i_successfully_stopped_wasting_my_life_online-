#post{{Hello! I hope you all are doing well with your nosurf journey. At peak addiction I was using my phone 8-12 hours a day. I spent most of that time browsing #a-t-reddit{{reddit}}, using social media, and talking to internet strangers. These days, I consider 2 hours too much (cumulatively throughout the day, 2 hours or even 40 minutes in one sitting is unimaginable to me now). A day where I've used my phone for 45 minutes to 1 hour in total is the norm, unless I've been reading a really long story or practicing a language. This is the story of how I stopped completely.

I'll preface by saying that I'm not a super active person. Some people say they use the web so much because they have nothing better to do. The point of stopping even without anything better to do is to *find* something better to do. #bad-bored{{Some days I can get really bored}}, #tech-do-other-things{{but I fill that boredom with other things}}. #other-activities-walk{{A walk}}, #other-activities-read{{reading}}, #other-activities-art{{doodling}}, #other-activities-writing{{writing my thoughts down}}, whatever seems good. If it matters, I'm a 22 year old man, started quitting when I was in college, and have successfully quit as a working adult. I also never used any blocking software or screentime app limits.

The first thing I did was #tech-deactivate/delete-account{{delete all my social media at once. I made a post on each one saying "Deleting my account, my number is (insert number) if you want to stay in touch}}" and then 24 hours later deleted them completely (NOT disable them, pause them, or anything else). There really is nothing to be gained from it except addiction and worse mental health. #withdrawal-urges{{I had a strong urge to redownload it and make new accounts}}, but I ignored the urge and it eventually went away, especially after realising how much better I felt. Anybody who doesn't keep in touch isn't worth it.

The next issue was #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}}, which I actually spent much more time on than any social media. These days I only use it to check this subreddit once in a while because I like to give advice, or look up questions whose answers are actually useful to me (for example, I consulted the photography subreddit before buying my camera). But before using it this way, I used to scroll for hours looking at dumb memes and arguments. I deleted my one account which actually had an email associated with it, lots of karma, etc. Even then I still browsed without an account a lot, so when I realised this I #tech-willpower{{just stopped using it completely}}, like it didn't exist. I had a VERY strong urge to go back on, and sometimes did, but over time the craving also went away, #tech-review-motivations{{especially when I realised how much more time I was spending on my hobbies}} (or even my chores, getting that all out of the way instead of procrastinating!) After a couple months of basically ignoring reddit's existence, I started allowing myself to use it for checking this subreddit only and finding useful answers to real queries. I no longer fall down reddit rabbit holes. I make an account so that I can give advice/share thoughts about nosurf, then either delete it or forget the password. Even this is something I only do a couple times a year.

Another problem was #a-t-search{{useless internet searches}} on things I'd never remember or care about. I'd get a random thought and immediately google it to see what other people thought, and I constantly wanted to know other people's opinions on everything even though I couldn't care less in reality. What helped me with this was, #tech-ask-why-when-picking-up-phone{{before pulling my phone out or typing on the computer, asking myself "Why am I about to search this?"}} and if the answer wasn't genuinely NEEDING to know something, I didn't look it up.

I extended that to pulling my phone out in general. I always asked myself "Why am I getting my phone right now?". This really helps with having a reason to use your phone instead of taking your phone out and then looking for something to do on it. 

I also completely #tech-misc{{stopped using my phone when I'm not home}}, except for calls or something urgent. On the bus, during a walk, in a store, waiting for my appointment, whatever, I'm not using my phone. Well, during a really long wait for an appointment I'll read news, but only in a real news app. That's not much different from reading a magazine or newspaper 20 years ago. #tech-rules{{In those situations I have a rule where I only let myself use the news app that I just opened, no other apps}}. I don't use my phone while walking at all unless it's a call. This really #ben-notice-more{{lets you take in the world around you}} and also #ben-better-handling-negative-emotions{{get more comfortable in situations where you're feeling anxious}}. #ben-less-introverted{{I feel less introverted as a result of almost never using my phone outside}}. The only reason I even take it with me is if I need to make an emergency call or a restaurant's menu is a QR code or I need to uber or use the GPS. I like to take pictures too, but only if I think it's a pic I'd like to come back to later.

Not that I use my phone much inside, either. I'm a fan of current events and read news in the morning and evening on my ipad (again, only on news apps, and I don't read the comments). I have short text conversations with friends. I practice language learning on my phone. And of course I use it for two factor authentication, ordering food sometimes, paying bills, online banking, etc. Basically I only use it as a tool. Using it while watching a show or movie is a sin to me. Once you do that for long enough, you view the phone less as an entertainment device and more as a tool to get things done. You no longer associate it with fun or time-killing. #tech-put-devices-away{{My phone sits out of arm's reach unless I need it for something.}}

This applies to my computer too. I like to play games once in a while, but usually #tech-time-limits{{limit myself to 3-4 hours a week}}. Like my phone, I only use the internet on my computer for things I need. Every week or two I also take a day to not use the internet or messaging at all, telling my friends to call only.

I could droll about being productive, but truly enjoying free time is also important. Yes, you can get lots of things done, we know this. Sometimes doing absolutely nothing is exactly what you need too, it is a time to self-reflect. You don't truly have fun when you're sucked into your phone either. 

I've noticed great improvements in my emotions since I've successfully curbed my addiction. #ben-feel-better{{I'm happier as a person}} and #ben-more-patient{{more patient}}. #ben-better-senses{{The world around me literally seems more "vivid" if that makes sense}}. #ben-better-handling-negative-emotions{{I cope with sadness more easily}}, which you really learn to handle when you're not pulling your phone out at the first sign of negative emotions. Not only that, but my good emotions feel even greater. I think that's because before, even if I was feeling good, my face was still in my phone. Now that I don't use it often, #ben-feel-emotions{{I let myself truly feel my emotions.}} I believe that when we're addicted to our phones, we don't really experience our emotions. Schr√∂dinger's emotion, never happy never sad, just distracted. Without the distraction, When I'm happy, I get to really feel it. When I'm sad, I cope with it, and remind myself that, if I'm feeling like this, it means I've felt really good before.

It involved being really out of my comfort zone. I relapsed often in the early stages. It took about 2 years. I had to cope with feelings I had previously only dealt with by distracting myself. #withdrawal-urges{{At every step, the wasteland that is the internet was calling me back}}. But it was 100% worth it. #ben-appreciate-more{{Ever since I quit, I can say for certain that I absolutely love life.}}

You can't get back the time that you wasted, but you sure as hell can save your future time.
