#post{{Flashback to january 2021, #tech-lost-phone{{I lost my phone}} long story. #withdrawal-irritable{{At first I was very irritable}} and #withdrawal-bored{{bored sitting at home not knowing where to stimulate my mind with my free time}}. #other-activities-exercise{{I had resorted to exercise just to feel calm and collected}}. #other-activities-watch-movies-and-tv{{Cable Tv still exists, and I begin to enjoy old shows}} like frasier and will n grace. I even saw a little of According to jim. Anyways those shows allowed me to pass the time. But it just another form of mindless consumption. It became very apparent that I needed to change how I spent my time. I noticed I have a bookshelf full of books, very few story books. So mostly books that will be productive to read. #symp-worse-concentration{{At first I couldnt read without getting bored after half an hour}}, I want to be interested for hours. A magazine I bought at the store said I actually should be reading for at least 10 mins every day. It has been much better retaining information over the course of months rather than once in a while sessions. Because the consistency creates a rhythm for your brain. Wake up, eat, learn, excercise, these activities dont have to last long but you must commit.

After the same routine for a few months, I notice I am not going out as much as my friends or neighbors are and #other-activities-go-out{{I begin to search for events or activities in my community}}.  This allowed me to discover smaller communities attending events every weekend. For example I went to this old theater and before the movie even started, this guy was talking on stage about the movie and asked questions to the audience to get them involved and to me that is participating in your community with like minded subjects.

Im ranting but the takeaway is that there is a phone that allows you to explore any world of desires you may have, such as reddits nosurf. But dont miss out on the opportunities from your surroundings, even in your own home.}}
