#post{{I wanted to say thank you to this subreddit. Although I wasn't very active here, it was one of the posts on this page where I found a local #tech-support-group{{ITAA group}}. I started attending it even though I didn't even feel like an internet addict, just like someone who wants to become more productive by wasting less time online. For a few months, I just went to meetings, shared a bit and still used the internet for entertainment occasionally.

I met up with a fellow member and she told me her story of becoming abstinent from everything that she used to overuse on the internet. I was using the internet freely for about half an hour a day at this point and my free time activities had already improved tremendously, #other-activities-go-out{{I was going outside more}}, #other-activities-misc{{doing my hobby (sewing)}} and #ben-more-time{{never stopped being amazed at how much time there is in a day when I don't spend it in front of the screen}}. Still, I decided to become completely abstinent the day after our meeting. I wrote down all the pages and online activities that were triggering to me and stayed abstinent from them. I attended more meetings, also online (lol). I had only cut out that last half an hour a day of free internet but the change was still noticeable. #ben-feel-emotions{{I felt more emotions, more intensively because I had numbed them with internet usage.}}

As I kept my abstinence, my life improved more. There was no magic change within a day but slow, tiny improvements. #ben-less-depressed{{I had already made the decision to do something against my depression and other mental struggles about half a year before joining ITAA, but the fellowship and my abstinence accelerated that progress.}}

A year went by. This year in March, I started having doubts about the program and my abstinence. I didn't feel addicted and I consumed some entertainment online to prove myself I'm not. Even though I didn't go into a binge, I could feel the mental shift. #symp-anxiety{{Consuming things on the internet makes me feel nervous, like my body is out of tune with the outside world.}} #symp-worse-concentration{{I get hectic and distracted, try to multitask and fail, as always.}}

The internet won't make me lose my job or risk my life but I can feel it is bad for me mentally. I use it to numb my feelings, intensify my feelings, avoid contact with fellow humans or myself, cope with my fears and self- doubt. It never gave me any solution. It is harder toâ€œ ask people in real life for help, to address a problem head- on myself, to work instead of consuming, but it's worth it. I feel balanced. #ben-better-handling-negative-emotions{{I can feel my feelings, which it turns out are not there to harm me and make me suffer but to guide me in how to live my life.}} I feel pain and then I know there is something I need to change. #ben-more-active{{I am more active, I do my hobbies and engage socially.}} I focus on what I really need in the moment when I want to go online. #ben-being-present{{Most importantly, I feel more alive, present, there in my body and in the world when I'm not glued to a screen.}}

My internet usage still isn't perfect. I switched to CDs and I'm noticing the struggle of finding analogue music. I still shop online because it is often very effective and I haven't yet found a better way. I switched to a flip phone for a while but got annoyed by the discomfort and now I am using my smartphone again. But I am aware of all of my media use and #tech-ask-why-when-picking-up-phone{{I try to question myself every time I turn on a screen. Do I really need to look this up?}} What is the thing I really need now, emotionally? And this way, I know I will figure out the bricks that are still loose in my abstinence.

The internet harmed me. I feel like I am only now, almost a year abstinent and one and a half years almost- abstinent, noticing the true scope of the negative effects my usage had on me. My brain is sometimes overflowing with information I read some time, somewhere online and it feels like my internal memory is cracking up. All the information, opinions, ideas, suggestions and lifestyles I read of online affect my thinking. I keep wondering how I should behave according to what some people said online instead of trusting my inner voice which hasn't been listened to for so long. I sometimes still have trouble concentrating on long texts and videos. #symp-misc{{My sexuality is twisted from my #a-t-porn{{porn}} consumption and the ideals it set up in my mind}}. I sometimes can't differentiate if I really want to do/ buy something or I only think I want it because I once saw it online. I still feel like I want to do every cool idea I ever saw online and feel overwhelmed by it and disappointed in myself. These things will take a long time to heal, maybe even longer than the time I spent online.

But I am living in real life now. And it's better here. 

At the end of an ITAA meeting, we always have a moment of silence for the addicted internet and technology user who is still suffering. Sometimes I think of myself when I was younger and sometimes I think of people like you here. I don't know you but I know your internet usage is harming you. I pray for you that you can get out of the twisted claws of the internet like I did. I promise you, it will be worth it.}}
