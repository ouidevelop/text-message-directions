#post{{Sorry if this gets all over the place, but I just wanted to share my journey to help some of you out. I used to spend 10 hours a day. #symp-bad-health{{Horrible skin, health, poor vision}}, #symp-worse-concentration{{brain fog}}, #symp-less-memories{{no memory}}, #symp-worse-concentration{{no concentration}}, #symp-anxiety{{social anxiety}}, #symp-feel-bad{{depression}}, #symp-less-clean{{bad hygiene}}, #symp-procrastination{{procrastinator}}, #symp-less-responsible{{no one could depend on me for ANYTHING}}, #symp-misc{{just overall a horrible “mindless” person}}. Does this sound like you? I cried and cried and tried to quit multiple times nothing worked. One day I woke up and said I can’t do this anymore. #tech-delete{{I deleted everything.}}

#withdrawal-time{{Week 1-3}}: Horrible. #withdrawal-misc{{Felt like I was battling a serious drug addiction.}} #withdrawal-tired{{Wanted to sleep all day}} and #withdrawal-bored{{felt like an empty bored zombie}}. #withdrawal-misc{{Felt so out of tune with the world}}.. but I had to stick to the plan so I did.

1 month: Started to get used things, however #withdrawal-urges{{had a growing pain to just check “one more time”,}} to see what’s been happening the month I’ve been away.

3 months: Started to find interests in other things. #other-activities-play-music{{Picked up a clarinet}} and was #other-activities-contemplative{{actually finishing books.}} My brain fog was going away. #ben-productive{{More productive}}, #ben-cleaner{{room was cleaner.}} #other-activities{{Started running on my free time}}. #ben-freedom{{Free mind and wellness}}. However, I did ALMOST have a set back. Went on a nice 2 week vacation and wanted to post about it. It made me so disappointed knowing I payed 1,000+ for this trip and no one was going to see it. But this was my test. A well needed one at that. If I can get over not posting this I can get over ANYTHING. In the end it felt good knowing the trip I took was for me and my enjoyment, and not something I wasted money on just to give something to show social media.

#withdrawal-time{{Month 6}}: #withdrawal-misc-social{{Pains for validation started to go down}}. #ben-misc{{Stopped having an interest in posting every single thing.}} Finally had a “flow” of life without the internet. #ben-made-friends{{Made more real life friends}} and putting in effort to grow bonds w/ all the free time I had.

Year 1: #ben-better-social-skills{{Social awkwardness went away dramatically.}} #ben-misc{{I was starting to gain my own thoughts and opinions.}} #ben-less-depressed{{Depression gone.}} #ben-less-bored{{Boredom gone.}} #ben-better-senses{{The world looked more colorful}} and #ben-misc{{everything was better}}. #ben-appreciate-more{{I found more interest in different things,}} #symp-bored{{where as in the past everything in real life became so boring and useless to me.}}

Year 2: #right-mind{{Now that I’m on the other side, I see people who use social media as “different”. Anytime I go out to eat or anywhere at that matter, all the phone buzzing and scrolling seems weird to me. I think to myself “what’s so special? I just don’t get it?”. I started to feel bad for those who still have the issue.}} You really see how long a person can truly be glued in. I think now I’m starting to feel like the person I was before I started. My screen time reduce to 50 minutes a day overall average.

#ben-freedom{{I now feel so free with out the social pressures}}, but most importantly.. I feel like MYSELF. I often find people boring because on social media everyone are just carbon copies of each other.  Women all look the same with the new set beauty standards and everyone copies each other’s opinions just to fit in. No sense of self identity whatsoever. I’ve cultivated my own desires and hobbies and I feel like it shows when I meet other people. I used to blame my lack of friends on being lonely, weird and social anxiety. But turns out it was because of my media abuse. I had no life and no emotions, in turn made me a boring person to be around.

In conclusion do it now. Please. You won’t regret it. And I don’t mean just checking  sm after 9pm, 25 minutes a day, or on the weekend..that doesn’t work especially if the addiction is deeply engrained in you. You must at the very least delete and if not UNINSTALL the app. Unless you’re making income, I just don’t see the point of slaving 4-12hrs a day just to see other people’s highlight reel. I get the excuse of being afraid to leave.. but I’m sure we all were alive and well before social media existed. If you could do it then you can do it now. 

Most importantly.. learn to fall in love with being bored. People are too scared of boredom. But this process will start off BORING beyond means and you have to accept it. It goes beyond “finding something to do” this is PURELY a self control problem. Self control isn’t replacing one habit with another. It’s being able to not continue the habit despite having nothing else to do. If you truly want to get your true old self back, there’s only one way to get there.}}
