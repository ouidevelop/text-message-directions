#post{{Greetings Human Beings!

I saw someone a few days who seemed infuriated on the forum that people are sharing their goals instead of their results, so here is a post about my experience.

I quit social media around July, I began by deleting my #a-t-instagram{{instagram}} and keeping my #a-t-twitter{{twitter}} and #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}} #tech-deactivate/delete-account{{deactivated}} until September when I had decided to #tech-deactivate/delete-account{{delete them both}}.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to detail my Journey below so I could help other people:

I had a phone addiction to the point where my average reached a high of 11 hours and 28 minutes by mid-June when I got my iPhone 11 Pro during its first week.  I decided to make a change by July and decided to quit Instagram cold turkey, and deactivate twitter and Facebook. My setback for the time being was that #symp-bad-health{{I had gained weight}} and #symp-inactivity{{remained largely inactive}}. #tech-therapy{{I also went to a therapist to help me cope and deal with my issues but he sucked so I cut back and went to another one a month later}}. by august and September my average was around 5 hrs per-day to 4.5 by the end of September.  by Mid September, I quit Facebook and #tech-blocker-cold-turkey{{installed cold turkey}} over the last two weeks to help me cement my journey without social media. over the course of October I got a harsh cold and ended being bed ridden for 5 days, and ended up challenging my self to using my phone less then two hours dropping the average from 4.5 hrs to around 1hrs 50mins  per day. This very last week I bested myself to 1.5 hrs and #ben-feel-better{{I'm extremely happy}}, #ben-less-anxiety{{I feel that I've reached some inner peace}}.

Finally I wanted to note a few differences that I have noticed:

\- I'm less inclined to text some of my friends even though I really really miss them.

\- #other-activities-read{{I have read around 6 Arabic (My native language) books in the last two weeks}} averaging  90-180 pages each.}}
