#post{{Hello,
I started nosurf in late 2015 and made it to about 100 days before returning to moderated use. Just wanted to give you a quick report here as there aren't many people writing reports for obvious reasons and because I remember that I would have liked to read them back when I browsed this subreddit. I went full hardcore mode - #tech-misc{{No internet, zero use of computers, no gaming, no TV, no radio, no looking at screens, no smartphones}}, etc.. #other-activities{{Started reading a lot and spent a ton of money on magazines}}. #withdrawal-insomnia{{Struggled with a lot of insomnia}}, #withdrawal-nausea{{nausea}}, #withdrawal-tired{{drowsiness}} etc.. #ben-vision-change?{{After about a month my vision started to change. It's difficult to describe. I could see differently. This was something I didn't expect, but it's awesome}}. Whenever I accidentally took a peek at a screen during that time, it #right-mind{{felt disgusting}}. When I returned to moderated use after 100 days, just looking at a screen felt completely unnatural. In the meantime, I returned to moderated use. Things are not as they used to be. I use a "traffic light" system - some websites are red, i.e. absolutely zero use. Some are yellow, i.e. moderated use. And some are green, i.e. unrestricted use. So while I have started spending more time on the internet again, I have rigorously eliminated all "red" things (#a-t-porn{{porn}}, hanging out on warez sites, mindless #a-t-reddit{{reddit}} browsing). Don't know what else to write right now, as I also don't want to spend too much time around reddit anymore. Please do this, it's one of the best things you can do for yourself. Also I would strongly advocate going hardcore. The moment you look at a computer screen after months of full abstinence is something you won't forget. THIS is what I spent years of my life with? - What an utter waste. Good luck!}}
