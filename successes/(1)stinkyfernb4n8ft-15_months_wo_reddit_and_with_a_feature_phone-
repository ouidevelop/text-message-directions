#post{{Hey guys. So here's what's happened so far...

Basically I got a #tech-dumbphone{{flip phone}}. Don't use the computer for #a-t-reddit{{reddit}} or anything. Went basically cold turkey. For context, I've been using the internet since I was about 10, and computers long before that because my dad was a programmer. (This was the 90's and early aughts, most people didn't even have home internet back then.) My addictive behavior was sort of manageable and often even helpful because I came from a shit home and had no social skills, so places like gURL.com (rip i love u), GaiaOnline, and various forums and small websites became my social life. It was good times. #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}} existed but was just chronological updates from friends instead of the dumpster fire it is now. Corporations hadn't taken over the internet yet. It was still mostly nerds who liked computers and made websites.

Then I went to college. Discovered #a-t-reddit{{reddit}} the same week. I remember spending entire days sitting on my shitty dorm bed, #symp-worse-school{{skipping classes}}, completely engrossed by this social feedback world full of nerds who also liked cats and hated comic sans. #symp-worse-school{{I dropped out after 2.5 months and do attribute that in large part to reddit's addictive qualities}}. I've been absolutely addicted to reddit ever since (until a month ago), and added other sites to that list too.

Anyway, I'm now in my mid-twenties. Using my phone about 4-5 hours a day. Here's how it went:

The #withdrawal-time{{first week or two}} was literal withdrawal. I'm not kidding. I didn't expect it. #withdrawal-difficult-thoughts-and-feelings{{My thoughts were racing like crazy}}, #withdrawal-anxiety{{I had a major jack in anxiety}}, #withdrawal-misc{{night sweats}}. #withdrawal-urges{{I kept pulling out my dumbphone and then realizing there was nothing there, and I would compulsively clutch it in my pocket.}} #withdrawal-restless{{**I felt uncomfortably tense all the time,** like mentally AND physically. I was clenching my jaws and couldn't unclench.}} It was wild.

Now it's probably 4-5 weeks later. A lot has changed.

I did regress a little in that I began watching a lot more #a-t-tv-and-movies{{Netflix}} and #a-t-youtube{{Youtube}} (previously not big issues for me) and #a-t-games{{playing my 3DS}} a lot. I'm going to probably limit myself to youtube and netflix each once a week on weekends. My 3DS only has Animal Crossing, so there's only so much time I can spend on it.

HOWEVER, what I've *mostly* noticed is that #ben-relief{{I feel an enormous sense of RELIEF}}. I felt like I was being constantly tugged, and I didn't even realize until it was gone. #ben-more-patient{{I am so much more patient}}. When I have to wait somewhere, #other-activities-being{{I can sit and wait quietly, looking out the window}} or #other-activities-socializing{{making smalltalk with older people (who, you know, still have social skills unlike people my age)}}. #ben-better-attention{{My concentration is better when it comes to work}}, #ben-misc{{and I'm certainly more disciplined}}. #ben-less-anxiety{{My anxiety is significantly calmed.}}

#ben-feel-better{{I finally find myself enjoying things again}}. #other-activities-walk{{Like, it turns out I really love hiking.}} #other-activities-being{{I like sitting in the sunlight.}} #other-activities-socializing{{I spend a lot of quality time with my cats and people in my life.}}

I don't feel the need to photograph everything anymore (and I'm an actual photographer). I went on a vacation and got kind of annoyed when everyone with me would scramble for their phone every time there was a nice sunset or whatever. A few times I actually did say, "Don't take a photo, just enjoy it". We went to a well-known modern art gallery, and people were literally just walking around taking photos of each piece and posing for photos. Like I think I saw maybe 10% of the people there not actively taking constant photos. Like, when are you going to look at those? What is the point of compulsively documenting?

So, some points on practicality. I have a pocket moleskine and a pocketbook calendar that I carry around. They both fit perfectly in a small purse. The pocket moleskine always has a pen tucked in it. For me, this has been so much more satisfying than taking notes on a phone, plus I can draw in it. I check my email once every day or two, just opening the internet browser (not with a desktop email client, which would be the same sort of barrage as normal). It's fuckin' great my dudes.

The only time I've wished I had a smartphone was yesterday when someone rear-ended me. In situations like that, having a camera and documenting everything really can save your butt. (I know because it did for me 5 years ago when a similar thing happened.) In this case, the man was a friendly, country type and we got everything squared away fine, and it wasn't a big deal.

I'm considering buying a cheapo compact camera to carry around for situations like that. The peace NOT having a smartphone brings me is more than worth keeping a little camera in the glovebox and carrying around a small notebook.

My only problem now is relating to people my age. Luckily I have some really good friends, one of which has always been a naysayer towards social media and scrolling, so we're fairly likeminded. We have conversations and go on hikes and no one pulls out their phones unless we need directions or (gasp) to take a phone call.


This was very long and disorganized. I kinda just wanted to get it out there. Feel free to ask any questions. Thanks again for being a great and pioneering community, r/nosurf.

edit: Oh, and thanks to u/YOUR_DEAD_TAMAGOTCHI and [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/ahyurn/the_end_of_an_era_im_done_and_thought_id_share_my/eel87f4/?st=jtlwhipg&amp;sh=fa112441) for kicking me into gear. It was the straw that poked me in the asshole, if you will.

editedit: I forgot to add (ironically), #ben-better-memory{{that my memory is WAY better}}. I have a terrible memory, I mean truly awful (started around the time I started being on screens a lot), and these days I actually retain things and think about them for a while afterward. Like I can still remember almost every art piece we saw at that gallery a week ago, and I can't help but wonder if any of the people taking pictures could say the same.}}
