#post{{I have gone from 35 hours, as an addict, to 14 hours a week. I started this project 3 months ago approximately. The brain is much more plastic than I thought, and positive effects seem to have come quicker than expected. Quickly; 3 days a week are totally offline, 4 days are not (3 hours max). No music and movies on net free days either.

**Here are the benefits thus far:**

\- **#ben-better-attention{{It helps my attention span}}** (I love reading books now), and don't easily get bored. Lately I'm reading about blockchain technology and Bitcoin, and previously, I promise, I'd never been able to pay attention to it. It'd bore me to hell.

\- **#ben-productive{{I'm at least three times as productive}}** (forced to be productive on net free days). This is a big one. One net free days, I'm forced to be productive. I allow myself to use the Internet here, if it is creative endevours or sending mails regardig that work (or creating music, creating youtube videos (script, materials and etc). Also; the lack of #a-t-games{{video games}} allows me to feel the same progress that I felt playing games, in real life. The body and brain doesn't know the difference between rewards in games and rewards in real life, which is why it seems like you have done a lot after a session of gaming (and don't feel like doing much in real life afterward; you have literally artifically been hijacked by something your body thinks is rewarding).

\- **I'm so clear in my mind** (#ben-clear-mind{{much less brain fog}}. Things seem so quiet around me, and much simpler; as if I've timetravelled back to the 90's; the quiet of the living room is very nostalgic). I think the lack of constant informational input, has allowed my mind to first digest my own stuff, before defaulting to "zero", without having to analyze any new info. There is no new input, so I'm simply analyzing what's in front of me in the moment.

\- **#ben-better-social-life{{My social life has improved}}**. I connect much more with people; especially on Net free days. On those days, I'm choosing to be social deliberately to make time pass (by having fun ofc), and meeting new people sometimes (or hanging with my people). I can promise you that I used to think I was an introvert, when all I did, in my addiction days, was to label it as an excuse for my addiction.

\-  **I don't analyse people all the time**. I think podcasts, and constant information input, and watching youtube and social dynamics in these youtube (or social media for that sake), brought me to similarly analyse social dynamics in real life as well. When we watch people communicate all the time we carry that analytical mind into the real world and analyze real people the same way.

\- **#ben-appreciate-more{{I genuinely look forward to do the little things again}}**; both in real life (like being in nature and etc; things that previously didn't trigger dopamine in me), but also virtually like watching a youtube clip, listening to music, watch a podcast. All of these things, in my addiction days seemed like default. Access to everything all the time equaled consuming everything all the time. Now, with my restrictions; I genuinely, even though I love the peace of net-free days, have fun playing games and being on the Internet. It's not a default anymore; and brings me joy (my 3 hours fly very quickly).

&amp;#x200B;

**- I'm not instantly gratified anymore, and don't want to be (which has made me productive).** I see how Internet usage had hijacked my reward system. I'm very happy that I am aware of it and taking drastic measures against it (being aware of it hijacking your reward system is a big step as well!), but I realize that I'm able to see projects through because my system no longer gets instantly gratified all the time. Not having access to all media all the time has been a big part of not being gratified all the time.

\*\*\*\*\*Here is how I did it:\*\*\*\*\*

First off; don't be too hard on yourself. Especially not in the beginning. Cutting down weekly time by even 20 percent is amazing. Allow yourself days with media consumption. But start with one day for instance without any. Or cut down 1 hour each day.

Gear:

#tech-smartwatch{{Get a smartwatch with a an e-sim}}. On the Net free days, leave your phone at home, people will be able to call you through your phone, but you won't be able to consume media. On days where net is allowed, ofc bring your phone.

\------

I am planning to carry on with a weekly schedule that has worked for me. It has drastically cut down internet usage, as said, by 60 percent weekly. I am planning to stay on this 60% decrease mark for a year, before I think I'll go up to a 70 or 80%.

Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays are days when I'm totally offline. No Internet or video games at all. I deliberately put them on days when I work. After coming home, spending half the day at work, I go training, and the rest of the day I'll read a book or listen to an audiobook. At least 90 percent of the day is gone without Internet.

On days where I'm allowed, I get a max of 3 hours. So 3 hours times 3 days are 9 hours. The last day I allow myself to have 5 hours (both because I've deserved it and see this day as a reward for the perseverance the other 0hour days, and because I think it's good for longevity's sake to have at least one day where I can enjoy Internet and gaming, it motivates me more to have those 0-hour days to know that I'll be rewarded at the end of the week).

The point is to drastically cut down hours percentage wise. And I'm doing it!

I'm going all in, and aiming to keep going like this for a year as I said. Cheers to the scientist in us!}}




#title:{{Nosurf has become somewhat of a weird passion for me. I think I've read over 10 books in-depth about the negative consequences of unlimited Internet and media usage, and I've been living a minimalistic (or let's say more balanced) way for a year now. This is the setup that worked the best for me}} #permalink:/r/nosurf/comments/sp71l1/nosurf_has_become_somewhat_of_a_weird_passion_for/, #created:1644500959 

#post{{My method is simply to  limit my media usage to 12 hours a week (approximately half of the world  average). The set-up goes like this:

Mon: 0 hrs, Tue: 3 hrs, Wed: 0, Thu: 3, Fri: 0, Sat: 3, Sun 3.

(You  can also go for 15 hours a week, which would give you one extra day of 3  hr-media time, and one less of completely free of media). 12-15 is the  goldilock zone in my opinion.

Having  a set up like this, with #tech-time-limits{{a timer that counts down the time I have left  per day}} is a perfect way to not be carried away. It also forces me to  stop and do something else when the time is up. On the days where I'm  not allowed (0hr-days), I simply am forced to do something else, either  #other-activities-read{{read books}}, #other-activities-misc{{build things}}, #other-activities-walk{{exploring new places (walking in unexplored  woods, territories, going for hikes)}}, #other-activities-productivity{{work}}, #other-activities-socializing{{be social}}, #other-activities-exercise{{be physically  active (I've set up training days on the days where no media is  allowed)}}. #tech-plan-time{{Set up a list of high-quality analogue acitivites that you  know you will enjoy before you start living like this}}, doesn't matter  what it is :)

A set up like this  gives you the opportunity to not be too strict with yourself, because  you after all have the next day you can enjoy media (for a full three  hours). At the same time, on saturday and sunday, you have two days in a  row, which serves as a motivator throughout the week.

Initially,  back in Jan 2021, when I started it, I must admit, that it was  difficult on those 0-hr days, but #withdrawal-time{{after a month or so with this set up, I  can assure you, it is very easy}}. You get used to it. It's just the  beginning that is challenging. This is not like drugs btw (not that I  know), your mind WILL react with withdrawal symptoms and not know what  to do, but it is very temporary, and initially intense, but only for a  short time.

Try it. It will give  your mind three days per week to be alone and digest its own stuff,  without any input, and at the same time you are forced to do other  things. Simultaneously, it is not so strict and so over the top that you  can't go through with it. It's really best of both worlds, bringing  analogue times (such as the 80's) into the digital world. A perfect  balance in my humble opinion :)

\-----------------------

\-----------------------

Some of the benefits by the way:

\-  Your attention span will tenfold; books that you read will feel like  movies, and you will absorb them like crazy. I think I ended up reading  51 books in 2021, the year I went all in on this.

\-  You will feel stimulated by gentle things, such as simply walking in  nature (waterfalls, weather, sights and sounds will start stimulating  you)

\- #ben-being-present{{Socially you are more present.}}

\- #ben-feel-better{{Anxiety and mental health are brought to normal levels (or at least they contribute a lot).}}

\-  Things sometimes feel like the 90's again, especially when you pick up  analogue hobbies again such as listening to vinyls, building lego (I  know, I'm a man-child, lol).

\- You enjoy your media time far more than previously.

\-  You stay away from the craziness of the social media world, and finally  can actually retrieve to a seperate world (the real world) where these  things just become a hobby or fun time-pass. The internet world is not  the "defacto" world. It is just a fun alternative take on the real world  (an imaginary off-spring so to speak)

Hope this helps :)}}
