#post{{I just want to share a success-story, even if it doesn't fit in with most of the nosurf content (I think)

I've been struggling with escapism for many years, resulting in panic attacks when I didn't have any content to watch (mostly #a-t-tv-and-movies{{tv series}}). I wouldn't necessarily binge, but I would watch anything remotely interesting to fill the void and spent hours planning my viewing behaviour and looking for news on new content.

This escalated more and more, every year I would watch more, have less days when I wouldn't watch anything and get more #symp-anxiety{{anxious}}. I was very aware of this being an unhealthy coping mechanism but I didn't know how to stop. I googled and googled but I didn't fit the criteria for addiction and it made me feel super lonely and alien and weird.

One day this summer I stumbled upon #tech-support-group{{Internet and Tech Addicts Anonymous}} which is 12 step program. I was super vary, it did sound a bit cult-like. But I needed support, needed to feel reassured that I wasn't overreacting and just feel heard. And they did hear me, and continue to hold space. (without being cult-y, lol)

I managed to change my viewing behaviour and only watch shows I really am interested in and care about. I also limit my news intake on entertainment related stuff. It's not a miracle cure, but I'm consuming way less than in the last 5 years.

I still track my consumption. In the last 5-ish years, the amount of episodes I watched was going higher every year. This year it was less. I went from 402 episodes a year (about 270 hours) to 293 episodes (about 195 hours). 

I understand that people who see this number could think that this isn't much, it doesn't sound like an addiction and I'm making a fuss. The important thing here is that I was suffering and I wanted to stop and I couldn't. It's not important weither or not I was pressuring myself "for no reason", I just wasn't happy with it. And I was able to change it, and #ben-feel-better{{I'm feeling way better about it.}} Please be kind.

Happy new year.}}
