#post{{#ben-freedom{{Tbh it is very liberating to not use these platforms}}, social media is essentially a place where you'll be comparing everyone's highlight reels with your daily life which by its basic nature will mostly be mundane and full of routines either created consciously or subconsciously.

Educating yourself about the harmful effects and the addictive trap most of these sites have is first step to really quit them.

I did many dry runs without essentially deleting me accounts but rather #tech-deactivate/delete-account{{deactivating them for long period of times}}.. #tech-deactivate/delete-account{{I went all in when I was comfortable going around 50-60 days without them}}.

A few things during the first few days you shall notice will be
- searching for alternatives(you aren't actually quitting media if you switch to reddit browsing)
- lots of free time at hand
- boredom and high amounts of fomo
- depression might kick in due to not getting your dopamine hits like you used too

Overcoming this part is real difficult but once you get over it things start to change

- you'll start doing things for yourself, developing this thinking will take time, for example a lot of people's first instinct today would be to post stories when they go travelling , take social media out of the equation and you'll see how most of us are actually travelling or doing things for the wrong reasons

- a new feeling of content will settle in soon

- if done right till this point , your focus and the ability to enter productive flow states will compound a lot!

- you'll also realize the nature of these chats wasn't  actually adding value to your life

Some things to take care of

- Ensure you establish some way of staying in touch with people you deeply care about, I wish I could go back atleast tell a few people I enjoyed talking with and exchange numbers to stay in touch.

- If your dry runs are successful and you don't mind your data out there on some database, deactivate your account and avoid deleting, it lets you reactivate for a while just enough to get back in touch with people once a month or so

- Cold turkey may not be the best way to quit for most of you

- have some things ready to channel your time and energy before you quit, else you'll end up being addicted to something else(read reddit)

That's my tips so far, feel free to ask me anything.

#post{{The positives
- #ben-more-time{{A lot more time}}
- #ben-more-self-esteem{{Positive body image}}
- #ben-less-comparing{{less of comparing myself with others}}
- #ben-feel-better{{a feeling of being satisfied with my own life}}
......I can make a list that's very long
Here's a link to my post about that:

But it's this one thing that keeps bugging me

The thing is with most of the world in a pandemic, I essentially can't go out and meet new people. Before leaving social media, I would meet a lot of people online/ interact with my friends/ people I know.

I used to be part of communities offline which connected me with these amazing people I would chat with online

I am essentially missing that benefit of social media a lot, #bad-lonely{{I really enjoyed talking to people and it's kinda lonely now}}, I also broke up with someone last year(we met on social media), and most my dates were enabled due to social media

What do I do? I have been in this dilemma a lot of times and don't know how to overcome it this time.
#bad-lose-contact{{It feels like I essentially need it to meet new people and potential dates}}.}}
