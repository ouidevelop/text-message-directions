#post{{ I quit social media \~10 months ago as I always felt unhappy with my usage.

Since then, my life has changed entirely.

It's actually kind of weird looking back and remembering how #symp-worse-concentration{{I could never use to stick to a bare minimum workout routine or even finish reading a book.}} I get genuinely upset when I think about how many #symp-wasted-time{{hours I used to waste}} on #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}}.

#symp-worse-concentration{{My attention span and dopamine threshold were fucked. My lizard brain was fully in control, I'd seek the fasted dopamine spike I could and then seek another before that one had even worn off. I'd be on my phone while watching movies, while with friends, and while I was supposed to be working on myself.}}

Then #tech-delete{{I deleted everything apart from youtube}} (the reason i decided to keep youtube and i returned to reddit was because I consumed that content differently, more info in my video if you're interested). After deleting it I felt my life streamline, I felt like I had killed a whole version of myself. All those people who I didn't speak to but I'd follow? Gone. This idea of myself that I portrayed online? Gone.

I felt freed from something I thought I was enjoying.

Then slowly, so slowly I didn't quite notice, I found that #ben-misc{{all my energy was going towards me and the real interactions I had}}. None of my headspace was being filled with people I barely know lives. #ben-live-in-reality{{I could just focus on reality}}. It felt like I'd taken the red pill. I was separated from everyone else, but because I didn't want to be like everyone else #ben-feel-better{{it felt amazing}}.

Because I couldn't engage in the same instant gratification I had for years, i found that I naturally drifted towards delayed gratification. #other-activities-exercise{{I worked out consistently (because I wanted to, not because i forced myself to)}}, #other-activities-learn{{I studied Spanish in my spare time}}, #other-activities-read{{I read every day}}, I invest my spare time in the future me, not current me.

For those of you contemplating getting rid of your social media, this is your sign to do it. For good. It'll genuinely change your life.

If you don't want to be the same as 90% of people, why would you engage in the same activities as them?

It's not a quick fix, It's a life choice, and now is your time to make it.}}
