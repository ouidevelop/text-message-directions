#post{{These may not apply to everyone and they are not particularly groundbreaking but here are some things that have helped me recently:

1. #tech-blocker-freedom{{Install a website/app blocker on your phone or computer. I really like the app Freedom because I am able to block websites that are distracting to me for up to 23 hours at a time.}}

2. #tech-put-devices-away{{Keep your phone in a separate room when you are home.}} If your phone is next to you at any time, you’re far more likely to pick it up. Sometimes it’s a reflex and you don’t even realize it.

3. If you find yourself deactivating your social media accounts and coming back to them a few days later, I recommend wiping them clean. #tech-unsubscribe{{Remove all your followers/people you are following and you will no longer feel compelled to continue using apps}} like #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}} or #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}} if there is nothing to see when you log in. This is how I was finally able to delete my accounts for good.

4. #tech-put-devices-away{{Don’t charge your phone next to your bed.}} If you are someone who immediately checks your phone as soon as you open your eyes, having your phone within arms reach can lead you down a slippery slope of scrolling instead of getting your day started.

5. #tech-stop-notifications{{Go to phone settings and turn off all notifications for apps that are not 100% necessary.}}

6. #tech-misc{{Reading}}. I know not everyone likes to read but reading books has helped me re-train my attention span better than anything else. It used to be very hard for me to read more than a few pages of a book without my mind wandering or thinking of picking up my phone instead, but now I can read like I did when I was a kid before my phone became more appealing. If you are interested in reading books pertaining to nosurf, I highly recommend #book{{Stolen Focus by Johann Hari}}.

6. #tech-do-other-things{{Find meaningful things to do to fill your time}}, otherwise you will fall back into the habit of mindless surfing. Set aside the time to figure out what it is that you are passionate about and gets you into a flow state. You can’t expect to be successful if you are spending all the free time you now have staring at the wall.}}
