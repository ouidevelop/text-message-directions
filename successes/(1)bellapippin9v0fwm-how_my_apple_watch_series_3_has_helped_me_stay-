#post{{Hey guys, I did a search for this and noticed all posts about this were a year old so I wanted to share my experience.

I was never interested in an Apple Watch or any other wearable tech because I found it dumb they still needed the "mother device" close. #tech-smartwatch{{But when the series 3 stand-alone (with data) came out I actually considered it for nosurf intention purposes , bought it to give it a try}} and I'm close to 1 year of using it (I bought it around xmas time). **This thing has helped me immensely**. Let me elaborate.

* The Apple Watch can't open/run social media apps other than the Messenger chat (and you can choose not to install it at all). That means no FB, Twitter, Insta, Snapchat, nothing. It does not have a web browser. Nosurf ready. Even if it could you could just choose not to install any. For people who use WhatsApp (I use it to text my family in Argentina for free) it will show you the text even if app isn't installed and you can reply but if they send you an audio or image you need to check the phone.
* With this in mind, #tech-phone-break{{I've been leaving my phone inside my backpack/anywhere else but where I am}} (like,  another room). When I'm home it might be on my bed, connected to my little JBL speaker playing music, while I do stuff around the house and just take the speaker with me.
* I don't get anxious about missing someone trying to reach me because if someone texts me or calls me, the watch vibrates (I typically set all my devices to silence as a preference). I check the watch, read the text. If I wanna answer I can dictate my answer or even send one of those pre-set answers. If I dont' want to answer then, I just put my wrist down. Same with calls, same with alarms. If I'm having a conversation with someone and I feel a tap on my wrist it's discrete and I know I got something, but I can just wait until it's a more appropriate time to check.
* During my commute I turn on the music on the phone connected to my BT headphones  (although the watch can connect to the headphones too) and put it away on my backpack for the rest of the commute. If I wanna skip songs, change volume, stop etc. I can either do it from the watch or the headphones buttons.
* As for the other useful apps, I can check the weather w/o taking out the phone, I have the public transportation app to check arrival times, and I like the watch taps you to stretch your legs or walk a bit on the 50th min of every hour if it didn't sense much movement during the hour, which encourages me to take a walk to the kitchen and drink water or w/e (I sit at a desk all day). If you use Apple Maps, the watch will give the instructions and tap you when it's time to make the turns. \[EDIT\]: I forgot to mention. I use it when cooking or going to the basement to do my laundry to set timers either thru the watch or I just say "Siri set timer for X min". Done. Or when I'm changing the water in my aquarium I'll ask Siri how much Gal is X Quarts so I know how much conditioner to put while I'm filling the bucket in the bathroom. Tasks get done and I don't go anywhere near the phone.
* Pro-tip: For super extended battery life (up to 2 days if people aren't texting you constantly!), set it to "theater mode" which means it won't light up the screen everytime it senses you lift your wrist to look at the watch, you need to tap it (it's designed so it doesn't light up on you at the movies). If I have gloves on I even tap it with my nose lmao.

This is just off the top of my head but my attachment/checking on the phone has decreased DRAMATICALLY since I have the watch. You don't need the latest model just get the last year one for cheaper if you want. The watch itself is meh just another toy but if you use it as a nosurf tool is TOTALLY worth it!

Hope that's some useful info for everyone.
