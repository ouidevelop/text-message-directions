#post{{I spent my teen on phone A LOT. I wake up. I'd check my phone for hours and check it again without any awareness until I go to sleep. All my teen. I mainly use #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}} and #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}}. I was a normal gen z. Facebook was my life. I like scrolling through my newsfeed. Everything was fun.

Until 2020. After I finished school, I tried to spend least time as I can on the phone because I was adopting the idea of "you're addicted to online media" stuff. So one day I decided to go further on Facebook by #tech-unsubscribe{{unfollowing pages}}. The result is I did spend LESS time on it.

But everything was different. I feel different. It's like #symp-lonely{{loneliness}}, #bad-feel-worse{{emptiness, IDK, bad feeling}}. To the point that I realized something was not right. After a few months passed, I try to follow more pages on FB again, I even joined Instagram. Disconnecting is NOT fun at all. But now it doesn't feel the same. I can't spend more than 5 hours on online media anymore. It feels different. I'm changed. But the change is drastic. #bad-feel-worse{{I'm lost}}.}}
