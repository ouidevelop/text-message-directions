#post{{I've probably owned over a 10 iphones in my life, and everytime I lost one/broke one I caved and bought another. I'm pretty introverted and not the most social, so this time I just started using fb messenger on my laptop once a day to contact people for about 20 mins, and I scroll #a-t-reddit{{reddit}}/#a-t-youtube{{youtube}} for about an hour a day.

Compared to my 10+ hours of screentime when I had a phone, I feel like I'm actually connecting with my life again and don't feel the need to compulsively pull out my phone when I'm eating, walking, going to the bathroom, whatever.

And #ben-better-social-life{{when I talk to people I feel like I can connect with them better too}}. Since I still have a desire for interaction that social media was fulfilling, I have to actually go out and hang out with people to fulfill it. #ben-less-anxiety{{It's made me less shy}} and #ben-more-confident{{more self-confident}}, simple-minded, #ben-less-anxiety{{and carefree}}.}}
