#post{{Edit: if you'd like to reach out to me, please email me at ollie.outreach@tuta.io. I'm going to stop checking reddit for a while as the PMs are triggering my dopamine drive. 

Hey Reddit, I've been trying to quit the internet since 2009 and I've been clean for the past 6 months. This is my story, it's long but I want you to know from the very bottom of my heart that even if it feels impossible now, you CAN regain deep thought, reading, daydreaming, your hobbies, reflecting on the day’s events before you fall asleep, forgetting about your phone for hours, having better sex, enjoying the feeling of consumerist lust fade away, regain your own opinions, realise that the news is entirely vapid, become resilient against algorithmic thought influences, spend time recuperating your body, and most of all…gain time! This community is really one of the few online dedicated to this effort and I want to thank you for the support that I've gained here.


I’ve posted my story below but if you can’t be bothered reading, my message is I want to help others. I know how low this shit takes you. The stories I read on here from fellow addicts pain me. I am empathetic, I listen, I’ve been where you are and I WILL understand you. IF YOU NEED OR WANT HELP OR A CHAT PM ME AND WE CAN TALK OVER THE PHONE. If you need a check-in once a week, we can do that, if you need someone to call in crisis I can be that person, if you just want to discuss your recovery strategy that's great.


My story begins in 2009, I arrive at university to study medicine, the same year I discovered #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}}. I don't blame the internet entirely but it conspired with drinking and partying to result in my drop-out. To be perfectly honest I probably wasn't ready at 19 but I remember even then desperately trying to install #tech-not-work{{Cold Turkey software}} to attempt to regain focus.


The next few years 2010-2015 were spent in community college and working. Me and my flatmate were living a bit of a nerd life so lots of #a-t-games{{Counter-Strike}}, #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}}, #a-t-forums{{forums}}, #a-t-shopping{{Aliexpress}} &amp; #a-t-shopping{{ebay}}, #a-t-torrenting{{torrenting}}, #a-t-tv-and-movies{{movies}} etc.
The city we lived in was pretty dead so other than my girlfriend and college I lived a pretty atomized existence. I remember hating the grip the internet had on me, giving my wifi dongle to my flatmate to hide, at one point deleting my Reddit account and swearing-off it. This cold turkey had a #withdrawal-other-cravings{{physical effect on me, I remember my desire to refresh was replaced with an insatiable hunger}}. I’d often find myself in front of the fridge opening it, remembering that nothing was in there, and returning to my room. And how could I forget getting my first proper smartphone, a Nexus 4 The beginning of our abusive relationship.


2015  heralded a big change, a move to the capital city, newly single, new job. I made it my mission to go to every Meetups event, as many tinder dates as I could wrangle, I took up dance. I had to keep a schedule and every night was full. I barely looked at my PC and considered those online years behind me.

 
But as you might expect life comes in ebbs and flows and as soon as my full-throated passion for social life began to fade, there was my old friend to fill the void. I had a long-distance girlfriend but she was overseas so I'd find myself on weekends staying in bed on my phone until the late afternoon, late, #symp-worse-sleep{{late nights}} afraid to confront the fact that I'd fucked up another bedtime, so I’d just keep scrolling on.
Morning would come, tired as fuck and swearing I'd have an early night but I'm sure you know this cycle and its endless repetition. During this time I’d tried tablet-as-a-phone (10 inch sim card tablet) as I thought this would make me stop. But it didn’t, I just used my phone on a fuck-off giant screen. I flirted with a Nokia KaiOS dumbphone but the friction was just too much, I couldn’t make it stick


Cut to 2020, career change, move cross-country for a new job, lockdown, shithole oppressive city, toxic workplace, anxiety, loneliness, Sundays spent dreading Monday. #a-t-games{{Gaming}} to maintain social connection, surfing until 3 am. Dark thoughts about work have consumed my life and I need to carve out some time on my phone for pleasurable, numbing, autonomy. Fuck them, they don't deserve me alert.


#symp-bad-health{{My hands begin to hurt}}. I stop being able to use the computer or phone. no amount of new chair or bullshit wacky ergonomic devices stop the pain. I have to quit my job, move home to parents. Fuck. 31st birthday and I live at home.


I start going to #tech-support-group{{Internet &amp; Technology Addicts Anonymous meetings on Zoom}}. The first one was the closest thing to a revelatory experience in my life. The feeling of a shared addiction experience is so fucking powerful. I’m not alone. I know the hand pain is my body telling me no more, my life needs a course corection. I begin working the Twelve Steps, Zoom meetings everyday, #tech-accountability{{calling members to check-in}}. #tech-make-less-attractive{{I bought an e-ink smartphone (A5 Plus). Everything on it looks like shit which feels good.}}

 
#other-activities-read{{I'm reading, I read every novel by Annie Proulx, read audiobooks, listen to longform podcasts with undivided attention.}} I'm feeling my feelings as best I can. #withdrawal-urges{{It’s so hard to resist the constant instinct to Google, that shallowest level of research. So hard to resist checking, checking, checking, checking}}. No one fucking emails me, I don’t need to check. I went through a phase of #tech-blockers{{using a blocking app on my phone}}, I could uninstall it of course but it meant that all I had to do was not uninstall it, which is a lot easier to follow than a million rules about what apps I can use when.


It's coming up to a year now at home. It's been hard, really hard. I’ve felt as low as it's possible to feel as the strands of RSI and internet addiction recovery interweave. But I've broken the back of it and it’s about 6 months now of no desire to use whatsoever. In fact, I think I hate the internet as it is now.


I don't consume news, I don't browse the internet, I don't browse social media, I use messaging apps in moderation. #tech-misc{{I have my phone on silent at all time}}. #tech-plan-internet-time{{If I need to online shop I note things in a paper notebook then buy them all at once without research binging}}. #tech-youtube-extension{{I do use YouTube, for example to search for a specific video on how to stretch a particular muscle, however I use browser plugins to block all algorithmic suggestions, autoplay, and the homepage.}}


Now my curiosity drive isn't being constantly sapped by low-level internet browsing, #ben-contemplation{{deep thought is returning hard}}. I'm thinking in ways I just have not been able to for the past decade. I'm rediscovering the magic of the library. To give an example, I borrowed a book on building timber-framed houses and the richness of knowledge and experience from the author was something I would never have gained from years of forum browsing on that topic.


My poor body had become a vessel through which I used the internet. I do feel bad about that still. #ben-better-physical-health{{This past year has been a reintroduction to myself, stretching, getting fit, learning how to self-massage}}, #ben-enjoyment{{enjoying movement}}.


I don’t use a blocking app any more. #tech-unsubscribe{{I unfollowed everyone and every group on FB so my feed is a blank page}}. #tech-unsubscribe{{The only subreddit I subscribe to is this one so I am given strength to close the tab if I stray onto Reddit}}. #other-activities-read{{I subscribe to magazines that feature long-form essays giving a much more textured view on ‘current’ events, often from the perspective of months or years out}}. I love not reading through the hysterical myopia of an ongoing news cycle.


Yes #bad-difficulties-with-others{{it will suck when you go to a friend's house and your mates are showing each other Insta reels for 30 minutes}}. We will need to find compassion and the patience to live as a tech-free member in a very tech-filled society.


Like I said at the beginning, I want to help anyone who needs it. If you need help or a chat about your strategies, please just PM me and I can call you anywhere in the world if it will help. I'm no expert but I can listen and we can figure it out together.}}
