#post{{I've spent nearly all of my free time on the internet for 15 years now (since 10 years old). Over the last 6 years, I've been experimenting with solutions.

I feel like I've gained a *lot* of wisdom on the subject. If you want to solve this problem, here is what I suggest:

What actually works
=============

## 1\. #tech-dumbphone{{Swap your smartphone for a dumbphone}}
&gt; It isn't about sacrifice. If you're addicted, you're already sacrificing your life for a few features. I suggest sacrificing a few features for your life instead. It's quite easy to live a normal life with a dumbphone. This eliminated about 25% of my aimless browsing. 

&gt; Even the browser on my dumbphone became a problem, so I asked the carrier to disable mobile data. Following that, I moved to a Nokia 3310 -- which doesn't have internet at all. Newer dumbphones seem to give off a "poor/technologically illiterate" vibe, which can be embarrassing. The Nokia 3310 gives off a "amusing nostalgia/anti-smartphone" vibe, which is personally preferrable.

## 2\. #tech-no-home-internet{{Get rid of your computer at home}}

&gt; Once again, you're already sacrificing your life for this convenience. Is the convenience really necessary? There are computers available at universities, libraries and internet cafes. You don't need yours. 

&gt; If you have a problem with porn, this and the above step will solve it. Very few sane people are willing to jack off in front of a public computer.

&gt; This won't totally divorce you from your internet addiction, though. I found myself spending all my time on the internet at university. This was partially solved by using up my 10GB allowance on a few Linux ISOs each month. I could still access all the important university resources, and nothing on the dirty wider web. Any place where you have an issue -- like an internet cafe -- I suggest asking the person in charge to restrict you.

## 3\. #tech-misc{{Leave jobs that allow for excessive surfing}}

&gt; This was the hardest for me. I've had four web developer jobs. All of them involved copious amounts of uncontrolled, unrelated web browsing. Believe me when I say I tried everything to fix it.

&gt; I finally decided that the profession wasn't for me. If you're addicted, maybe the profession isn't for you. Find something that doesn't allow you to lose control day-in, day-out. That's the bitter truth.

## 4\. Get tested for ADHD-PI and take medication for it

&gt; People with ADHD-PI tend to be internet addicts. The symptoms are pretty similar, too. I decided to give diagnosis a try, and I was surprisingly diagnosed with ADHD-PI. 

&gt; Do I actually have the condition? I don't know. The diagnosis was incredibly subjective. All I know is that, for the 8 hours that a 20mg dose of #tech-medication{{Ritalin}} SR is effective, my compulsion to browse the internet utterly disappears. My diagnosis and medication were absolutely invaluable.

&gt; Do not discount how well medication might work. Do not discount that you might be diagnosed with ADHD-PI. It could change your goddamn life.

What you need to know
=============

## You're already making a sacrifice

&gt; Right now you're already sacrificing your time and happiness for a few convenient features. Do you want convenience, or do you want your life back? You can do almost everything with a dumbphone and a public-access computer. If your addiction is on the job, is there really no alternative? Think about what you're *already* losing.

## You are not in control

&gt; I tell people that denying the compulsion to browse is like holding your hand on an electric fence. Your brain is not a logic-machine. It's mostly instinct. That instinct will determine most of your behaviour. Willpower is not a lasting strategy. If you want to take control, you need to change your environment enough for the short-term instinct to be powerless.

## Pleasure is relative

&gt; If you're stuck playing video games all day, or on a constant media-loop, *of course* other things don't interest you. You've conditioned yourself to find a high amount of pleasure normal. When you're addicted, everything sucks except for the addiction. When you give up, everything sucks altogether.

&gt; The bright side is that when you give up, you will eventually start to find pleasure in experiences that were otherwise painful. You will start to find pleasure in studying, socializing, exercising and so on. Those will bring you just as much joy as the internet used to. I no longer need to motivate myself to do these things, to stop procrastinating -- *I just do them because I want to*.

## It isn't about some sort of repressed emotional baggage

&gt; Stay away from this kind of pseudoscientific psychobabble. You're not addicted to the internet because you were bullied. You're addicted because the internet is highly pleasurable, because you were exposed to that pleasure over years, and because the brain uses pleasure to determine motivation.

## It isn't about willpower and discipline

&gt; Brute self-control is only effective for people with mild issues. Willpower is a short-term method of asserting control. Addiction is a long-term inability to control. For anyone with a real problem, it isn't effective, and it isn't sustainable.

What helps, but doesn't always work
=============

&gt; The following strategies can be effective, but didn't work in the long-term for me. I won't explain why, because ignorance can make these work a lot better.

&gt; 1. #tech-blockers{{Site-based blockers.}} [K9](http://www1.k9webprotection.com/), [StayFocusd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en), [Leechblock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock/), [WasteNoTime](http://www.bumblebeesystems.com/wastenotime/), IE Content Advisor. Set a password and give it to a trusted person.

&gt; 2. #tech-blockers{{Time-based blockers}}. [Aquarius PC Lockup](http://www.aquariussoft.com/pc-lock-up/) (unlimited trial) and [Screentime](https://screentimelabs.com/) ($5/mo). Set a password and give it to a trusted person. These are good for getting to bed, or to university, or somewhere you need to go.

&gt; 3. #tech-misc{{Contract with a friend. I had all of my internet usage tracked with [Qustudio](https://www.qustodio.com/en/) and set up a contract with a friend. If I disabled the tracking, or they saw that I went to any time-wasting sites, they would get $150}}. Of course, I wasn't willing to pay $150 just for a visit to Reddit, so it worked pretty well.}}
