#post{{So, story time, what you need to know is that I used to have a massive #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}} addiction and, to a smaller extent, a #a-t-youtube{{youtube}} addiction.

I'd find myself visiting those sites almost subconsiouly, typing r and y on the Chrome search bar whenever I wasn't doing anything in particular.

I'd spend all of my  life there. Literally everyday went by when I'd wake up in the morning, binge watch garbage with no value, then suddenly it was night and time to sleep.

It took me a long time to realise I had an addiction. I used to blame everything else about why my life suddenly stopped being productive and why I wasn't achieving anything anymore. I wasn't like that in the past so what gives, right?

I started eating healthy (no more junk food, more fruit, better meals, mostly home cooked), I started stretching and eventually working out (my shape is better than it has ever been), I even started a sleeping pattern and stopped going out for too long in the night (now I wake up at 6:30 in the morning, sleep at 9 at night).

So, life fixed right? This is the advice everyone in those self-help  forums gives? I was just a lawyer sort of having their so called perfect life (get this reference and we're officially friends)

But my life wasn't fixed. It didn't work. It made me feel like I was born a failure, like something was wrong with me. As far as I was concerned I did everything right. So if I'm still #symp-less-productive{{having problem being productive}}, #symp-worse-social-life{{being social}} etc. then I have a problem and I'm a lost case.

I don't remember how exactly it happened but at some point I ran into this subreddit and similar "internet addiction" forums. (I had ran into them before occasionally but didn't pay much attention because "I'm not addicted to the internet, lol, I can quit whenever I want.")

When you hit your lowest point you're willing to try anything so  I said, sure why not. Let's do it. If I could fix everything else this will be a cakewalk and I probably could use the free time for other things.

Imagine my absolute *shock* and *horror* when I realised I couldn't do. I literally couldn't stop going online and binging reddit and youtube. Whenever I was not on the sites I'd just subconsiously go back. Whenever I turned the PC off I'd just turn it back on again. "2 more minutes" became the rest of the day and even a good sleep program is useless if all you do daily is stay in front of a screen doing essentially nothing.

The realisation I had a problem hit me like a ton of bricks and I remember being shocked enough that I just stared at the screen and was so angry and scared I was thinking maybe I should just break my computer. (No money tho so nah)

To make an already long story shorter (won't go into details of the stuff I tried) I eventually figured out a last resort that wasn't as extreme as cold turkey or restrictive as someone watching over me/a schedule I knew I'd break eventually.

I figured that the reason those sites drain my days  is because the garbage that does so is so easily accessible. The issue seemed obvious now and I figured "what if it wasn't so easy for me to just endlessly scroll and find something to waste my time"

**What I did!**

So here's what I did. I decided I'd "destroy" my homepages on both sites. "If they had nothing of value in them then the sites are as good as done for me."

#tech-unsubscribe{{Starting with Reddit, I unsubscribed from everything, putting some essential art and music subreddits etc. into multireddits. Now the only things I'm subscribed to are:}}

* /r/theXeffect 
* /r/nosurf (duh)
* /r/LifeProTips 
* /r/Stoicism 
* /r/socialskills 
* bunch of stuff that never appears in my homepage and I'll unsubscribe immediately if it does.

Similarly #tech-unsubscribe{{for youtube, I'm only subscribed to **documentary channels** and Kevin, making my best attempt to **ignore recommendations and hiding them** when they seem like interesting but are obvious time wasters.}}

As a final touch I put a restriction on me, ON TOP of doing this. #tech-time-limits{{I **allow myself to only stay on these sites for a max of 1 hour**, making sure **I count myself using an analogue stopwatch in the most purposely boring way possible, making staying on those sites an absolute chore**.}}

Now, for the crescendo, I started using **Duolingo and Brilliant.** Now, whenever I'm online I make sure to be doing either of these things.

* Solving science problems
* Learning German (obviously works with any language, lol)
* Watching documentaries
* Occasionally visiting my "news" multireddit to see what's going on in the world.

**The result**

So what happened? Did it work? Did I keep my addiction on top of becoming the most boring nerd possible?

Well, actually it freaking worked!  I'm no longer addicted to Reddit or youtube. Watching anything other than documentaries is boring to me now and whenever I'm on Reddit I'm barraged by other people's success stories, tips and tricks for life, important information and reminders  of my crippling addiction, why not to go back and how to combat it if I ever relapse.

Essentially **my drugs became my cure** and #ben-feel-better{{I'm happier than ever.}}

*Yeah, that sounds great but what about your social life?*

It's greater than ever.

#ben-better-social-life{{I have so much interesting shit to talk about.}} The other day I just had a conversation with people about bride kidnapping in Kyrgyzstan and the Kumari godess of Nepal. I learned that on youtube. And I also talk about learning German, about science, world politics. And now that my confidence in talking about things and being an interesting person has returned, I talk about the other fixes in my life. Why I don't drink, why I sleep early, my home workout (which is admittedly not as good as the one in a gym, but there's something called a Callisthenics gym. I learned that on youtube, lol)

My life is on the right track now. #ben-feel-better{{And I never was happier.}}

**PSA**

Internet addiction is not a joke. Nobody is talking about this. We all suffered from it. We're fixing it now. We're morally obligated to inform everyone. To help them in any way we can. I won't go into cheesy speak about how we are "survivors" or stuff like that but we are pretty cool regardless, we managed  to  beat an addiction and we did that without help from anyone else but ourselves and perhaps each other here, without information and PSAs from anyone outside. 

If anything, the world *wants* us to be addicted. To youtube, to porn, to everything that makes money for those who'd see us destroyed.

Don't do them the favour. Help yourselves and then help everyone else. We battled addiction. It's not a joke. We're not  going back and we don't care if people laugh or joke when we say we had an addiction to youtube or reddit or the internet in general. We came out stronger and we're never getting addicted to anything again. We finally own our lives.

Also, sorry for the wall of text.

**TL;DR**

Had a youtube and Reddit addiction. Cleared my homepages to only show education and self-help information. Joined Duolingo and Brilliant to learn useful skills. Now I have no addiction and have interesting things to talk about so people like me better.}}
