#post{{**Why it was a problem?**

I've spent more than 6 hours a day on a screen of some sort for as long as I can remember. It started with a desktop computer as a teen, then evolved to a laptop, then an iPad and now the phone.

I'm anxious. #symp-anxiety{{I'm always anxious}}. I have so much anxiety. Whether I'm at home, out with friends, on the bus, at university, at work. Just always anxious. I want to not be anxious.

Unlike a computer, you can carry your phone everywhere. You have access to information everywhere. You don't have to suffer the pain of boredom even for a second. That was my problem.

A quick look at my phone activity and I could see, my daily activity was between 5 to 7 hours a day. Ridiculous. That's more than half my waking hours staring at my phone. That's not including me on my computer when I'm working. My whole life at this point is basically governed by a screen.

Although work wasn't something I could get away from, my mindless phone-scrolling was. It was time to make a change, and a serious commitment was needed.

#tech-track-time{{I downloaded an app to track my phone usage}}. My average usage when starting was **5 hours and 45 minutes**. Ouch. A starting point.

**Note:** If you want a detailed video version of this post, DM me and I'll be more than happy to share the video with you or you can just search *"How I broke my phone addiction in 7 Days, the improvement journal" on YouTube.*

&amp;#x200B;

**How I was going to tackle this**

* #tech-rules{{I've tried 'moderation' before. It hasn't worked. I moderate little by little till it becomes a full-blown addiction. No moderation. I will have set hours when I can check my phone, period. Usually twice a day.}}
* #tech-track-time{{The application I installed had a hovering counter that told me how much time I've spent on my phone for the day. This would keep me conscious every time I do use it.}} #tech-app{{(The app is called Your Hour)}}
* I listened to music everywhere I commuted because I'd get anxious. No more. I'd have to learn to commute without being plugged out of the world.
* #tech-phone-break{{I would not take my phone when I leave the house. I know this will raise a lot of eyebrows. That's where I use it most. On a bus, out with my friends, at work. Distracted everywhere. If the world follows me everywhere I go, it's hard to break this addiction. I would let my friends know where I'd be at the start of the day or what time to meet and I would show up at that time.}}
* #tech-delete{{Uninstall all social media applications off of my phone. #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}} and #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}} were my two biggest issues. I decided to uninstall #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}} as well off my phone. Leaving nothing but a bare-bones call making device with WhatsApp which I rarely used.}}
* Keep my phone usage under 45 minutes a day. I wasn't someone who spent time on phone calls anyway so social media was what I had to keep off for the most part.
* I was going to do this for 30 Days and see how it fairs.
* I haven't had an emergency I needed a phone for in as long as I've had a phone so I wasn't too worried about that.

**Week 1**

* What am I supposed to be doing. \*Stares at phone\* Buzz damn it. Why is nothing happening. Okay, I'm going to head out to work \*Taps pocket out of habit\* Wait, I'm not supposed to be taking my phone with me. #withdrawal-anxiety{{Okay, why is this making me so anxious?}} This is an inanimate object that I'm so afraid of not taking with me. This addiction was worse than I thought.
* At work. I keep tapping my pocket. Okay, no phone. What am I supposed to be doing if I'm not checking my phone every 5 minutes? #withdrawal-fomo{{What if I'm missing something important from my friends? What's if someones DM'ed me. Ugh.}}
* #withdrawal-misc{{I really miss music}}. Walking around to the grocery store, going to the gym, and doing repetitive tasks at work without music is bothering me.
* I started spending more time on my computer. Yes, that's right. My brain was looking for another source of dopamine. Even though I had Facebook uninstalled, I had it on my computer. I had to make the decision of not using these applications on my computer either. Difficult but necessary.
* Day 6, I checked my usage. It was at under 30 minutes a day.

#withdrawal-time{{**Week 2**}}

* This is really inconvenient for my friends. They call me and my phone is off. They message me and I reply in a full business day. It's not great when you have a lot of 'text friendships.' I had a lot of them apparently.
* I didn't know who was doing what. Where the party was at. What's going on in everyone's life. I was very ill-informed. I had to hear about things happening in people's lives by them telling me. This was actually strange. Isn't this how people are supposed to share their life experiences? By telling one another? Now I ask someone, hey how was your vacation? "Oh, didn't you see my Instagram photos? Ugh, let me show you," This was strange. Was it now the norm to catch-up on everyone's life online as opposed to actually having a conversation? I never thought about this.
* Forgot all about wanting music.
* #withdrawal-misc-social{{The thought of not knowing what was happening on my Instagram would still bother me. I have a fair following on there and I get a lot of DMs. In the back of my mind, I was still thinking about it.}}
* By week 2, my need to check my phone had SIGNIFICANTLY reduced. My weekly average phone usage was 18 minutes.

**Day 30**

* I'm not distracted at work. I don't reach to check my phone every 5 seconds.
* I have more conversations with my colleagues and friends. When they text me, I just tell them "Hey, let's get on a video chat soon" or 'Hey, let's grab a coffee and talk about all that." #ben-better-social-life{{It is SO much more enjoyable to hear someone narrate a story in person than hearing it from them over text.}}
* 30 days in, it was clear. This inconvenienced everyone in my life more than it inconvenienced me. People had trouble getting a hold of me. But. Did I want to be *accessible to everyone all the time*? It's like having your shop open 24/7. I didn't. I wanted to do the things I was doing regardless of any input from other people. Think about my problems, my aspirations, not what other people wanted to talk about. #ben-freedom{{This was freeing.}} Taking control of what you think about.
* My monthly average was around 30 minutes a day. This is a bajillion percent reduction from when I started.
* I made an active decision to sit and listen to music on my laptop. I ENJOYED the experience. I enjoyed the music, the sound, the lyrics. I wasn't using it as background noise but I was appreciating it the way it was meant to be experienced. Wow, I sound like a hippie.
* The thought of checking social media never occurred to me. It was gone. Out of sight, out of mind. I can't believe how simple it is. You just forget about it when it's not in front of you, in your pocket, everywhere you go.
* My 'text friends' dropped out. I was just no longer in touch with them and it seemed to have made no difference to me. My entire relationship with them was run through text. I reached out to them to ask if they wanted to video chat, then all of a sudden it became a commitment because now you had to book a time. It's not as convenient as texting. It really made me think, do we text and communicate because it's the most convenient form of communication that satisfies our social cravings or because we actually care about one another? In my case, unfortunately it seemed like the former.
* #ben-less-fomo{{I was no longer getting FOMO. How do you know what you're missing if you don't know it happened?}}
* #ben-less-anxiety{{Ignorance is bliss. This is true. I don't have all of the world's problems to worry about.}} I woke up today, worried about making my tea, reading my book, meditating, and going to the gym. I don't have to worry about Rebecca not being able to decide on an outfit, or Sam thinking Patel's a douche. I don't need to know about how your boss was rude to you. It doesn't make my day better, I don't need to know. This might sound incredibly selfish but it's great for my mental health. I'm concerned about those I care about and myself, that's it.
* #ben-less-anxiety{{My anxiety has NEVER been lower. I don't remember a time when I wasn't anxious. I am more stress-free than I can recall. This is a beautiful change.}}
* #ben-more-time{{SO MUCH TIME}}. I have HOURS on my hands that usually just ran by because I was in a zombie state scrolling mindlessly.

&amp;#x200B;

**Points of Concern**

* If you run a business and you have to stay in touch with clients, not having a phone will not be an option. However, not having social media on your phone is a choice you can make. Making phone calls isn't much of an addiction and you'd be doing it strictly for work purposes.
* I wasn't worried about an emergency until there was one. My girlfriend got really sick and really needed to get a hold of me. LUCKILY, I had taken my phone to work that one day because I was going to attend a business conference with my boss later that day. Because I had it on me the one day in my entire life when I had an emergency, I was able to tend to her and take her to the hospital. You never know when this can happen. My phone time was of course much higher on these days because I was keeping track of her progress; the health of a loved one is more important than an arbitrary metric.
* If you're someone whose relationships are strictly based on text. This will be a problem. You'll need to somehow convince your friends to talk to you more on the phone or remain in the text-relationship. I actually didn't know how limiting texting was up until I did this.
* Take your phone with you on days you're expecting to be contacted. If you've applied for a job or if you're expecting a friend to land from the airport. This is supposed to be a lifestyle change, not a temporary experiment for you to relapse eventually.
* I have quite a connected following on Instagram and YouTube. I make it a point to check their messages once a day to respond. It's important to continue doing the things you are doing and find ways of doing them without any negative mental effects.

**Conclusion and Steps Forward**

* It's been 3 months at this point. Safe to say, I'm making no decision to go back. I've done it long enough at this point to know what to expect, what to polish.
* I have cut out my social media usage long enough to know what a healthy balance looks like.
* I still spend more time watching YouTube videos on my iPad than I would have liked. This is going to be my next goal: Limit on-screen experiences and prioritize real-life experiences. It's important to give yourself a little time to enjoy these conveniences too so the odd day, I'll indulge.
* What gets measured gets managed. I was tracking my phone time every single day and that's the only reason I was able to keep it as low as it was. If you don't know how much you're spending, or even if you think you're not spending a lot of time on your phone. I encourage you to check your screentime. for 90% of the people I've told to do this, they were in denial till they saw their numbers.

**#ben-appreciate-more{{All in all, this is what I've gained**: Appreciation for human connection. Appreciation for friends who are willing to make time. Appreciation for all things outside a screen. I don't think any amount of likes is worth losing out on the experience of the real world.}}

I feel this is a change I've needed to make for a long time and I've finally made it. If you want a detailed video version of this post, DM me and I'll be more than happy to share the video with you or you can just search *"How I broke my phone addiction in 7 Days, the improvement journal" on YouTube.*

I wish this gift on everyone who's struggling with such an addition - I'd be glad to help you on your journey. Please let me know if you got any value out of this post. I've probably missed some important points while writing this post too so I look forward to hearing from all of you!}}




#title:{{90 Days of having QUIT Instagram | FULL Review and RESULTS!}} #permalink:/r/nosurf/comments/fnvp8m/90_days_of_having_quit_instagram_full_review_and/, #created:1585010878 

#post{{**Why it was a problem?**  
 

I've spent more than 6 hours a day on my phone and most of that time was spent on Instagram. In fact, about 3-4 hours a day was just spent on Instagram. That’s a quarter of my waking hours. You can track your hours using screen time on iPhone or using the app YourHour on Android. I encourage you to check it out, I guarantee it’s more than you think it is.   
   
 

I finally decide to address this because of how anxious I felt throughout the day. For no reason. I’d be anxious at home, anxious at work, anxious crossing the road. Every time I was anxious, I would reach to social media to curb my anxiety. I didn’t want to be anxious anymore. 

   
 

I wanted to reduce or eliminate my mindless phone-scrolling was. It was time to make a change, and a serious commitment was needed. I have tried uninstalling Instagram before and even using it in ‘moderation.’ This never worked, I always ended up getting right back on and it developed into a full-blown addiction EVERY TIME.  
   
 

**Note:** If you want a  much more detailed video version of this post, DM me or search "Quitting Instagram for 90 days The Improvement Journal."

 #tech-misc{{The first step I took was to conduct a Cost-Benefit Analysis of having Instagram in my life}}. These are my perceived costs and benefits BEFORE implementing the change. As you read, you’ll see that the actual costs and benefits were quite different.

 **Cost-Benefit Analysis of Being on Instagram** (Perceived)  
   
 **Benefits:** 

1. I talk to most of my friends on Instagram exclusively. We text every so often.

2. It’s entertaining. I find funny memes, cool pictures and videos.

3. I keep track of what everyone’s doing. 99% of what I know about what people in my life are doing comes from Instagram or Facebook.

4. I feel like I’m in the loop, like I’m part of a community. If I weren’t on Instagram, I’d feel left out.

5. I could share what I’m doing in my life to keep my friends updated. 

6. I have 8000 followers on Instagram, I need to be in touch with my followers. 

**Costs:** 

1. I spent a LOT of time on Instagram. **3-4 hours** a day and **6 hours** or more on my phone. Yikes.

2. I feel anxious because I’m constantly scrolling. 

3. It subconsciously made me feel inferior to everyone else.

4. I kept refreshing my Instagram to see what kind of response I was getting on my posts, this would keep me refreshing for HOURS.  
   
 

These were my initial impressions. Based on this, I was mainly quitting Instagram to be less anxious and have more free time.  
   
 

**How I was going to tackle this**

&amp;#x200B;

* Moderation doesn’t work for me. I had to uninstall the application. I needed proper commitment, nothing half-assed.
* I was going to stay off of Instagram on my phone and on my desktop. No consumption of Instagram in any way, shape, or form. 
* I made one last post on Instagram and called it quits. 
* #tech-rules{{While I was doing this, I decided to limit my overall phone usage. I gave myself only certain times through the day when I could check the phone. }}
* I was going to restrict my phone usage and with that process, drastically reduce my social media time.

.

**Week 1**

&amp;#x200B;

* Instinctively unlocking my phone to find the      application where it used to be and not find it. Okay … that’s      disappointing. I must have checked my phone 20 something times randomly before      realizing what I’m doing. I did it SO subconsciously, I didn’t even      realise when I was reaching out for the application.
* Why do I need to check what other people are doing      EVERY 2 MINUTES?! Imagine sitting next to a group of people and asking      them what they are doing every two minutes – that’s what it felt akin to. 
* Well, there’s nothing to do on my phone. What am I      supposed to be doing?!
* What if someone DM’ed me? What if someone’s trying to      reach me? 
* Day 7, I checked my usage. It was at under 30 minutes a      day. The Instagram usage had gone from 3-4 hours a day to basically 0. 
* It’s not all good news though. Now, I wanted a      different distraction. I spent more time on my laptop. More time on      Facebook, more time on YouTube. I wasn’t realizing it at the time but this      was going to grow worse.

**Week 2**

&amp;#x200B;

* Yep, it got worse. Now I was spending hours on Facebook      and YouTube instead. I had to cut out Facebook as well as YouTube was      still relatively under control. 
* It’s amazing how much the brain craves the kind of quick      gratification that social media provides. I wanted it, I wanted it so bad.
* I missed the quick gratification, but I did not miss      Instagram. It just wasn’t there. Out of sight, out of mind. I genuinely      did not think about it at all.
* *I didn't know who was doing what*. Where the party was at. What's going on in everyone's      life. I was very ill-informed. I had to hear about things happening in      people's lives by them telling me. This was actually strange. Isn't this      how people are supposed to share their life experiences? By telling one      another? Now I ask someone, hey how was your vacation? "Oh, didn't      you see my Instagram photos? Ugh, let me show you," This was strange.      Was it now the norm to catch-up on everyone's life online as opposed to      actually having a conversation? I never thought about this. This was a      strange realization.
* The thought of not knowing what was happening on my      Instagram would still bother me. I have a fair following on there and I      get a lot of DMs. In the back of my mind, I was still thinking about it.
* By week 2, my need to check my phone had SIGNIFICANTLY      reduced. My weekly average phone usage was 18 minutes.

**Day 30**

&amp;#x200B;

* I didn’t take my phone to work. I wasn’t distracted. I      wasn’t reaching for my phone every 2 seconds because not only did I not      have it, there was no Instagram on it
* I have more conversations with my colleagues and      friends. When they text me, I just tell them "Hey, let's get on a      video chat soon" or 'Hey, let's grab a coffee and talk about all      that." It is SO much more enjoyable to hear someone narrate a story      in person than hearing it from them over text.
* 30 days in, it was clear. This inconvenienced everyone      in my life more than it inconvenienced me. They wanted me to know about      what was happening in their life because they put it up on Instagram. A      friend would tell me about their vacation for example and tell me to go      like their pictures. They would genuinely be unhappy if I did not provide      them the validation of liking their pictures. So, is it more important to      people to get acknowledgement for what they shared on social media than      in-person acknowledgement? Scary thought.
* My monthly average was around 30 minutes a day. This is      a bajillion percent reduction from when I started.
* The thought of checking social media never occurred to      me. It was gone. Out of sight, out of mind. I can't believe how simple it      is. You just forget about it when it's not in front of you, in your      pocket, everywhere you go.
* *My Instagram 'text friends' dropped out*. I was just no longer in touch with them and it seemed      to have made no difference to me. I only talked to them on Instagram.      Actually, most of the time we would just be forwarding photos and videos      to each other. My entire relationship with them was run through text. I      reached out to them to ask if they wanted to video chat, then all of a      sudden it became a commitment because now you had to book a time. It's not      as convenient as texting. It really made me think, do we text and      communicate because it's the most convenient form of communication that      satisfies our social cravings or because we actually care about one      another? In my case, unfortunately it seemed like the former. It actually      became clear to me, as selfish as this sounds, which friends I needed and      which I could live without. Unfortunately, I could live without 90% of my      Instagram ‘friends.’
* I was no longer getting FOMO. How do you know what      you're missing if you don't know it happened? Ignorance is bliss. This is      true. I don't have all of the world's problems to worry about. I woke up      today, worried about making my tea, reading my book, meditating, and going      to the gym. I don't have to worry about who went on vacation, who’s      getting married, who got the latest iPhone. I don’t have to worry about      how that would affect me, or how their phone is better than mine. This      might sound incredibly selfish but it's great for my mental health. I'm      concerned about those I care about and myself, that's it.
* My anxiety has NEVER been lower. I don't remember a      time when I wasn't anxious. I am more stress-free than I can recall. This      is a beautiful change.
* SO MUCH TIME. I have HOURS on my hands that usually      just ran by because I was in a zombie state scrolling mindlessly.

   
 

**Points of Concern**

&amp;#x200B;

* If you run your business through Instagram and you have      to stay in touch with clients, this will obviously be a problem.      Moderation is the only way to fix this. I know for a fact moderation      doesn’t work for me but it might for you. You can always schedule the time      you check your Instagram throughout the day instead of whenever you have      your phone around. You can also restrict using Instagram to using it on      your laptop, makes it a lot harder to sit at a desk and scroll all day. 
* If you have genuine friends whom you talk to on      Instagram exclusively, inform them of what you’re doing so you can still      keep talking to them on other platforms. If you're someone whose      relationships are strictly based on text. This will be a problem. Your      Instagram friends might be just that, Instagram friends and nothing more.      That’s okay but just keep it in mind. 
* I have quite a connected following on Instagram and      YouTube. I make it a point to check their messages once a day to respond.      It's important to continue doing the things you are doing and find ways of      doing them without any negative mental effects.

Let’s do a cost benefit Analysis of QUITTING Instagram.

**Cost-Benefit Analysis of NOT Being on Instagram** (Actual)  
   
 **Benefits:** 

1. LOADS AND LOADS of Free time. I’m talking HALF THE DAY in free time. 

2. More time for recreational activities. #other-activities-play-music{{I picked up the guitar}}, #other-activities-misc{{started taking up salsa dancing classes}} and #other-activities-exercise{{starting to go more often to my jiu jitsu classes.}}

3. You filter your friends. ‘Friends’ is a term we throw around very often but who are your real friends? The friends you meet in person or talk to on the phone and talk to or the ones you share memes with? There’s a big difference. Your Instagram friends won’t come see you in the hospital, but they might like the picture you post from the hospital. BIG difference. 

4. I don’t have to care about everyone, and that’s fine. The less you know, the less you have to worry about. FOMO is AMAZING. It isn’t fear of missing out anymore, it’s the liberation you get not knowing what you’re missing. This was probably the BEST thing I got out of quitting Instagram. Worrying about only my problems. I have NEVER, I repeat NEVER in my life been this stress-free.

5. I don’t care about who went on vacation, who drives a shiny new BMW, it doesn’t matter because I don’t know. There are enough things to worry about in this world, you can’t worry about everything. Being in a bubble is good. Problems are relative. Don’t take on more than you need to. 

6. #ben-less-comparing{{The explore page – comparing yourself to people you don’t even KNOW. Not only was I comparing myself to my friends but to RANDOM people around the world. Why? Why did I need to? I didn’t.}}

7. I saw the value in real-life conversations. Sharing life experiences in person is very, VERY different than making an Instagram post about it. Imagine sharing news of a newborn on Instagram as opposed to telling people about it in person. The best moments in your life need to be shared but shared in person. We’re missing out on this.

8. I lost Instagram followers, 1000 followers. That’s fine. I was attached to the validation I got for each post I made, each story I put up. I was constantly refreshing Instagram for this validation. It was eating away at me; I don’t need it.

9. #ben-more-intentional/controlled{{I could intentionally choose where my time is spent}}. My mind LONGS for the kind of gratification social media provides and once you’re away from it for a while, the mind will grow accustomed to this new level of stimuli. I was being BOMBARDED with information on social media, so my threshold was just VERY high. Now I’m back to the basics, and the basics are all I need to feel happy.

10. No more rabbit-hole scrolling through the explore page. It’s never ending and just a cause of distraction. #ben-being-present{{I’m now more present when I’m in transit, with my friends, and just at home.}} #ben-misc{{I can sit with boredom. I can enjoy doing nothing. My new baseline is doing nothing to feel happy, not needing to feel distracted to feel happy.}}

**Costs:** 

1. #bad-lose-contact{{I lost followers. I can’t interact with any followers that may be reaching out.}}

2. #bad-lose-contact{{I lost touch with my Instagram friends.}}

3. #bad-difficulties-with-others{{I had nothing to do when everyone else on the dinner table is on their phone.}}

4. #bad-lose-contact{{Some people genuinely only share very important life changes on social media, I’d never find out about them unless someone brought it up by chance.}}

**Conclusion and Steps Forward**

&amp;#x200B;

* I’m 90 days at this point and I have NO intention of      going back. It's been 3 months at this point. 
* I have cut out my social media usage long enough to      know what a healthy balance looks like. For me, the balance is NO      Instagram, Facebook Messenger only (only on my desktop) and Whatsapp.      YouTube as well but that’s only because I upload YouTube videos. 
* I still spend more time watching YouTube videos on my      iPad than I would have liked. This is going to be my next goal: Limit      on-screen experiences and prioritize real-life experiences. It's important      to give yourself a little time to enjoy these conveniences too so the odd      day, I'll indulge. I have already begun vlogging about my No YouTube week      so stay tuned for that coming soon.
* *What gets measured gets managed.* I was tracking my phone time every single day and      that's the only reason I was able to keep it as low as it was. If you      don't know how much you're spending, or even if you think you're not      spending a lot of time on your phone. I encourage you to check your      screentime. for 90% of the people I've told to do this, they were in      denial till they saw their numbers.

**All in all, this is what I've gained**: Appreciation for human connection. Appreciation for friends who are willing to make time. Appreciation for all things outside a screen. I don't think any amount of likes is worth losing out on the experience of the real world.  
   
 

I feel this is a change I've needed to make for a long time and I've finally made it. Again, if you want a  much more detailed video version of this post, DM me or search "Quitting Instagram for 90 days The Improvement Journal."

The only way for you to know if this is something you NEED is to try going without it long enough to see what utility you get out of it. Never feel like you NEED to be on social media. It’s a construct of our society, not something we can’t live without. Especially Instagram. It’s not exactly important to find a job, connect with loved ones. There are other social media applications that you can use for this, ones that aren’t as addictive.  
 

If you’d like to try it out, I'd be glad to help you on your journey. Please let me know if you got any value out of this post. I've probably missed some important points while writing this post too so I look forward to hearing from all of you!}}
