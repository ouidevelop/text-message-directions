#post{{Hey guys, DrNoSurf here. I have always had problems with smartphone overuse. Smartphone addicts can understand the frustration. Recently, I read this book called #book-how-to-break-up-with-your-phone{{'How to break up with your phone'}} by Catherine Price. It's a good book with many practical points on how to change your phone habits. After reading it, I devised my own strategies for overcoming this problem.

Here's a list of 10 things which worked for me:

1. **I realized this is a problem**. That's the first step of solving any problem: realizing you have a problem. Smartphones steal time and attention. There are benefits but risks far outweigh them.
2. **#symp-bad-health{{Noticeable changes in Health and Behaviour}}.** #symp-bad-health{{Watery eyes,}} #symp-worse-sleep{{lack of sleep}} with #symp-tired{{resultant tiredness}}, #symp-irritable{{irritability}}, #symp-worse-concentration{{low attention span}}, #symp-worse-concentration{{mental clutter.}} Noticing these pushed me to change my phone use pattern.
3. **Desire to spend quality time with my family.** I realized that time wasted on phone could be well spent with my little one, strengthening relationship with my wife.
4. **#other-activities-read{{Replaced some of my phone time with Reading}}.** I used to be an avid reader. My smartphone was affecting  my reading habit. So #tech-do-other-things{{I replaced some of my screen time with immersing myself in a good book.}}
5. **Books like #book-digital-minimalism{{'Digital Minimalism'}}, #book-the-shallows{{'Shallows'}}, #book-deep-work{{'Deep Work'}}, #book{{'Why We Sleep'}}, #book-how-to-break-up-with-your-phone{{'How to Breakup With Your Phone'}}.** These books made me realize how these devices negatively influence our lives.
6. **#tech-delete{{Deleted Social Media Apps}}.** It doesn't matter whether you find social media interesting or not, if you have social media apps on your phone you will compulsively open them. Deleting these apps greatly reduced my usage of phone in general and social media in particular. #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}}'s \"explore\" feature is a digital black hole. Now the apps are off of my phone, I use these services on my computer once or twice a week for 20 minutes max. The biggest time-sucking platform #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}} is undeletable from my Vivo phone. What a shame! #tech-misc{{So I have moved to a folder on my phone's third homescreen in a folder titled 'Useless Apps'.}}
7. **Using #tech-app{{'Your Hour'}} app.** An appblocker\/tracker that helped me manage my screen time.
8. **#tech-scheduled-off-time{{Scheduled Switch-off Time}}.** I have set-up my phone so that it switches-off automatically at 9pm. This is very important because it makes sure that my phone does not mess with my sleep. I also regularly use 'Airplane Mode' on my phone whenever I feel like throughout the day. #tech-dumbphone{{I have diverted my calls to another number which is in my dumbphone}}. Where I live, it costs me 1$ per month to have another number with basic plan just for calling. Now I can leave my smartphone at home without the anxiety of being without a phone in case of an emergency.
9. **#tech-put-devices-away{{My bed is a No-Phone Zone}}.** I try to keep my phone out of my bedroom or at least away from my bed so I don't grab it at slightest hint of boredom. This way I also don't reach out for it first thing in the morning or at night if I am unable to sleep.
10. **#tech-time-limits{{Sunday is a No-Phone Day}}.** Once my phone automatically switches-off on Saturday night, I don't turn it back on till Monday morning. I need one day to completely devote to me, my family and my hobbies. My dumb phone is on in case anybody wants to reach out to me for an emergency. This break of about 36 hours is a pure bliss.

&amp;#x200B;

This list is not a one-size-fits-all. I curated it carefully, after trying out things which didn't work for me in the past (#tech-not-work{{greyscale}}, #tech-not-work{{cold-turkey}} etc). I have been on this regime for 2 months now and my screen time has come down to less than 1.5 hours a day. Although I am not perfect and sometimes I indulge in mindless scrolling on my phone but it works most days of the week.}}

#post{{Hey guys, it's DrNoSurf. Some of you guys might remember my post on How I Broke Up With My Phone https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/jk6sep/how_i_broke_up_with_my_phone_10_things_that/

Just here to update on my progress. So far it has been quite successful. 
November's average phone usage was 1 hour 42 minutes.
December's average usage is 1 hour 30 minutes so far.
I'm glad i brought it down below 2 hours. Please note that these timings do not include music, maps, audiobooks, tools like calculator etc. I still use my phone as a tool for taking pics, paying my bills, navigation, calling, texting, investments etc.

Next year's goal is to keep the usage time below 1 hour 30 minutes.}}

#post{{Hey guys, it's DrNoSurf here. I made several posts on my digital minimalism journey previously. I have been successful sometimes and have failed too. But I realise it's a journey not a destination.

Today, I finally watched The Social Dilemma on Netflix. It's quite an eye-opener. Good thing, I got rid of my social media long back. I have not deleted my accounts, I just don't use them anymore. Today, #tech-delete{{I deleted almost all the apps from my phone}} including Youtube, Chrome, #a-t-spotify{{Spotify}}, #a-t-audible{{Audible}}, #a-t-email{{Gmail}}, #a-t-kindle{{Kindle}}, #a-t-goodreads{{Goodreads}} etc. One might argue that audible and kindle apps are the useful and productive ones. But I believe that as a smartphone addict, I would like to minimise my motivation for picking up my smartphone (even for productive apps) because almost always one thing leads to another.

The only apps on my phone now are banking and payments, maps, an uninteresting system browser, and the usual system apps such as camera, calls, music player, calls and sms etc. 

Now there is no entertainment value in my phone but it still could be used as a tool.

Hoping for the best. Peace.}}

#post{{Hey guys, it's Dr. NoSurf again. Here's my update on my digital minimalism journey:

1. Deleted most of the apps from my phone. Disabled youtube. I don't keep streaming apps on my phone. I prefer to use them on smart TV instead.

2. Disabled all my social media accounts - especially Instagram (it's explore feature is a rabbit hole).

3. No more shopping apps on my phone, that means no window shopping. If I want to purchase anything from Amazon (90% of the times, it's a book) I use my computer.

4. Phone switches off automatically at 8pm. There is no automatic switch on. I do it manually the following day, delaying it for as long as possible. So my phone stays off for 12+ hours a day. 

5. #tech-rules{{No phone in bedroom. No phone in bathroom. No phone in front of kids.}}

6. #tech-stop-notifications{{Most of the notifications are off}}. Only exceptions are calls and texts.}}
