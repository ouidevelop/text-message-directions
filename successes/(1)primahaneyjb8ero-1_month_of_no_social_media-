#post{{The 11th was one month since I (24F) deleted all of my social media except for #a-t-reddit{{reddit}}. I have #other-activities-read{{read 16 books in their entirety}} and binged a new show. #ben-less-depressed{{I feel noticeably less depressed and also have no idea what is going on in the world}}. I watched the social dilemma on netflix which is what made me want to take the plunge. I limit my reddit time but can't bring myself to delete it like the rest. I had an active #a-t-twitter{{Twitter}} account for over 10 years and not being on it anymore has been a very welcome breath of fresh air.}}
