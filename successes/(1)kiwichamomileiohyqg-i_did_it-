#post{{I've been trying to cut down on using my phone for so long - I have #tech-not-work{{tried deleting everything}}, #tech-not-work{{changing to greyscale}}, #tech-not-work{{using a timer}}, etc. etc. but it always just seems to creep back. I was really resistant to buying a new phone when I have a perfectly good one, and it felt like the only problem was me. I guess these things are really made to be addictive.

I finally have the chance to give my phone to someone who'll use it, #tech-dumbphone{{so I coughed up and bought a dumb phone}} (with GPS, so not entirely dumb). I'm so excited! The times I've managed to successfuly cut down on using my phone have been some of the best, #ben-better-attention{{most focused}} and #ben-less-anxiety{{relaxed}} weeks of my life.

#bad-difficulties-with-others{{The weirdest thing has been the aggressive resistance from other people to me doing this. Some of my closest friends have been really negative about the whole thing}} - saying "how will I communicate with them without FB messenger" (this is from *someone I live with and see every day* and who never checks messenger either) and they "think it's a dumb move". People really think you can't live without a smartphone.

I'm very excited though, and am so happy I can finally get rid of my phone without guilt.}}
