#post{{So yesterday when I was scrolling reddit I saw a post about my former life and I saw how many people felt the same way I did for many years. Here is the post: https://www.reddit.com/r/starterpacks/comments/9f8srj/passive_guy_who_isnt_really_happy_starter_pack/

So nearly four years ago I decided to quit the internet because #symp-negative-self-image{{I hated my life}}. #symp-less-motivation{{I never felt motivated to do anything other than being online}}. All I was doing was watching #a-t-porn{{porn}}, being on #a-t-reddit{{reddit}}, #a-t-youtube{{youtube}}, #other-activities-offline-games{{play video games}} and social media (to watch girls).

I had zero life outside of this. #symp-bad-health{{I gained 40 lbs}}, was barely moving. #symp-bad-health{{I had a lot of back pain and wrist pain}}. When it comes to porn I was watching everything, when I say everything I really mean everything. It exist, I already orgasm to it. I joke saying that I'm a straight guy who probably jerk off to more gay content than a gay who watch porn from time to time.

So basically I was living online. It's one thing to be living online as a teenager, it's a whole other thing to be 32 in my parents basement and still doing it. 

So before going with what I have done that worked here what I did that did not work:
#tech-not-work{{- porn filters}}
#tech-not-work{{- managing my time online}}
#tech-not-work{{- working out}}
#tech-not-work{{- doing other activities}}
#tech-not-work{{- eating healthy}}
#tech-not-work{{- using tricks like edge surfing, cbt from my psychologist}}

Those methods do work, I just think they work for someone who is an addict, but still has some kind of life outside of the internet. For people who has zero real life support, no friends, social anxiety, depression (not the clinical one, but the self diagnosed one) they won't work if you are still spending all your time self medicating. You need to face your thoughts.

So how easy is to live without internet ( or very little of it ), well it's probably be the hardest thing you have ever done in your life up to this point. #withdrawal-misc{{It was an absolute living hell for me}}. Since I was 13, I had never went more than a week without internet and that week was self-impose and back fired big time.

What does someone without a life do when they don't have internet... They play video games all day long so I had to cut that off as well. I was never a big fan of watching tv, but my television watching increased, now I couldn't get rid of the tv, but also I couldn't watch it all day long. 

#withdrawal-bored{{Days were long man, they were super long}}. #withdrawal-urges{{I kept feeling like buying a new computer and a new phone to replace the ones #tech-remove-devices{{I had my parents taken away}}}}. #withdrawal-time{{So about 3 weeks in I felt the need to be online decreasing}}. #withdrawal-urges{{The urges comes in waves so you are doing good for a few days and then horrible}}. It's just that with time the good days start to last longer than the bad ones. With time the #withdrawal-frustration{{frustration of not being able to go online}} turned into acceptance.
That was about 2 months in and only then did I fell receptive to the help of my psychologist. Only then was I able to really start trying to do what they say in the self help book.

I think around 2 years and 4-6 months this where I really realize that my life was so much better than before. #ben-better-social-life{{I have a gf for a year and 6 months}} ( 14 years apart from my first relationship that only lasted a week), #ben-productive{{a shitty job and I went back to school}}. #ben-more-intentional/controlled{{I can easily go on the internet without the fear of "accidentally" going on porn sites. I'm also more able to stop myself from mindless scrolling or video watching.}}

I honestly don't think any of this would have been possible if I kept trying to get better habit while I'm still doing the bad one. It's like a junk food addict who tries to better their lives was still eating at mcdonald every day, it's just not going to work. }}
