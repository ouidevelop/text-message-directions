#post{{A few months back, I was a different person. Social media, updates, notifications used to be the constant noise at the back of my mind. Just like many of you trying to get out, I was stuck too, In that viscous cycle. The good news is that I have #ben-more-time{{not wasted almost any time}} surfing the web.

How I did it: #tech-misc{{using **tools** instead of willpower}}

1. #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}}:
   1.  #tech-youtube-extension{{"DF Tube"}} browser extension which removes recommendation and much more.
   2. #tech-delete{{Remove the youtube app}}. If needed you can still view important ones through chrome.
2. Other Social Media Apps:
   1. #tech-deactivate/delete-account{{Permanently delete you account}}. Take a deep breath and just do it. You won't even feel a difference the next day.
   2. #tech-obscure-password{{If you need your account alive for some reason, change your password to random gibberish}}. Now you have to forget password every time to log in. A step further? Send yourself a "future mail" with the password.

It's really not that difficult. When you want to stop eating cookies, you don't buy a box of cookies and keep it in front of your face and just hope you won't eat any. What you do is, you don't **buy** cookies. This is a short reddit post and I plan to keep it this way. If a few of you guys are interested, I might write a more detailed post about the entire process.}}
