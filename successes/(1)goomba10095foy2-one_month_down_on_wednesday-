#post{{So it all started with me trying to find an answer for why am I nervous and scared to apply for a job. Sorry for the grammar mistakes and typos I'm not a native speaker.    

It was months ago and that time while I was browsing Reddit for answers I found this subreddit. I read some posts but to be honest I tried to deny the fact that I have a problem with surfing. So this way I spent another month hopelessly looking for jobs but never pressed the button for applying. I spent days thinking about practicing programming and learning new things but I always ended up browsing #a-t-youtube{{Youtube}}/ #a-t-reddit{{Reddit}} for hours. Endlessly refreshing #a-t-tumblr{{Tumblr}}, #a-t-twitter{{Twitter}} and even #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}} to find something interesting. Reading #symp-feel-bad{{all the annoying #a-t-news{{news sites}} which only made me feel even worse}}.  Woke up in the morning and the first thing I did was checking Twitter and endlessly scrolling on #a-t-instagram{{Instagram}}, watching so many stories. Also started reading Reddit on phone so by the time I left my bed it was already 10:30 or 11:00 in the morning. I felt #withdrawal-bored{{bored}} so many times and never tried to play games, crochet or just do some programming, nope.  Just kept scrolling.

I don't know what happened to me a month ago but I realized I needed to change my habits because if I continued I would stay this loser forever. First, #tech-accept-problem{{I accepted that I have a problem with surfing}}. I used to play too much with video games and managed to stop this and reduce it to a healthy level but at the cost of developing my serious surfing regime. #tech-nosurf{{I read this subreddit and the tips on the right side were pretty useful I'm really grateful for those}}. So I invented my way of keeping surfing in check.

I can't go totally offline because talking with my sister in law is only possible via Messenger and I like to talk to my friends on other platforms. Also, I'm looking for jobs and practicing programming.    
 
I would like to thank [u/kaane](https://www.reddit.com/user/kaane) for their tips on the little notebook. First of all, I #tech-delete{{deleted Instagram and Reddit}} apps on my phone and since I really hate notifications but had the badge only on Twitter I turned that off, too. On my PC I installed the #tech-youtube-extension{{chrome addon DF YouTube and turned off comments, recommendations, related videos and the feed}}. This is my new regime:


* Wake up in the morning, write down the time and go downstairs without checking anything on my phone. #tech-time-limits{{I'm not allowed on PC nor phone for at least one hour after waking up.}}
* When I do check the phone while the sun is up it's only for emails and Messenger but it's not like too many people write me so it takes me 10 seconds. #tech-track-time{{If I do that I write down the time in my little notebook so I can see if I go overboard.}}
* I do important things while the sun is up, like programming, checking out jobs. I do my planned things from notebook if I feel tired of the previous things.
* I used to have Tumblr and Twitter on my firs two tabs. I'm not allowing myself to do this anymore.
* #tech-do-other-things{{I need to do some hobbies. I wrote down if I feel like I need to scroll. I used to have many so it's not hard to choose from.}}
* #tech-plan-time{{Before bed I have to write down my next day plans}}, at least three things and I write down when I went to bed.

Since I #tech-do-other-things{{keep myself occupied during the day}} I feel like I #ben-productive{{accomplished more things under this one month}}. Wish I started doing it earlier! I have no idea about what's going on my Facebook feed anymore and also my time spent on Twitter and Tumblr were reduced to 10-10 minutes each and I check them only in the evenings. Best thing is that since I installed this addon I only watch the videos from my subscription field and then I move on and don't end up watching all the scenes from Madoka Magica for example. #other-activities-learn{{I managed to finish a SQL tutorial and now learning Python programming}}. Also, it took a while but I finally applied for a job! I spend way #ben-outside-more{{more time outside}} and #ben-more-patient{{I'm not angry anymore if I have to wait for my dog too much.}}

I don't say it's easy because there were some weak moments but I think I handled those well. The weak moments can occur if my daily routine is broken by something unusual but I learned to properly valuate if I really should spend more time on that or move on. I just have to keep going forward.}}
