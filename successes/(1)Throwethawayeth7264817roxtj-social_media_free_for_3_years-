#post{{My solution is you just have to #tech-delete/deactivate-account{{delete your account}}. Getting a dumb phone and putting screen limits etc are all temporary fixes that rarely work. You just have to delete your account. Once its gone and all your followers are gone you will be less enticed to use it or make a new account.

Sometimes I use #a-t-youtube{{youtube}} or lurk in this subreddit. But for me my issue platforms were #a-t-instagram{{instagram}} and #a-t-snapchat{{snapchat}}. If I do find myself on YouTube longer than I'd like to be ill use #tech-blocker-freedom{{freedom}} and block it for 24 hours and it will usually be the reset I need.

Also learn to stop self indulging yourself, stop allowing yourself dopamine when you didn't do anything to earn it. 

And finally stop engaging in comment sections its not going to make you feel any less lonely your favorite egirl doesn't really love you stop having parasocial relationships. Interact with humans join a class, go to the bar, go to the gym. 

That's pretty much it might be all over the place but that's how I did it}}
