#post{{I have been clean for a few months now and I feel like i'm living a new life. I first realized I had developed new habits after I had asked a friend to root my phone and help me cut down on using #a-t-youtube{{youtube}}. Two weeks later, after he had asked me to get back to him to see what he can do, I realized that I never did. I didn't need to anymore. That realization was extremely satisfying during that moment because I had seen all that I have tried doing finally showing fruit. I had failed so many times but each time I did, I had to get back up, learn a new lesson, and then try again. I couldn't control when or how frequently I had fallen down but in the end I had to change what I could've changed and believe that I could pull that change off and that's exactly what I did.

#ben-better-school{{Ever since then, I've been absolutely killing it in university getting a 3.7}}, #other-activities-volunteer{{helping out in my church}} and #other-activities-offline-games{{improving my chess}}. It's a new life that I couldn't be anything but grateful for. I had a chance to realize I can choose my response to whatever situation I'm in no matter what is and take the initiative. I gained nothing pitying myself and blaming my outside for my inside. I believed I could do something, and you can do something too, everyone can.

I realize that perhaps this isn't as serious as I made it out to be for some people out there but I know there are others like me who have suffered like I did. This is an addiction to a lot of people and they can begin by admitting that first and foremost and then do something about it and I'm here to tell them that they really can and t it's really worth it. 

Feel free to ask any questions, I'd be glad to know I could help out anyway I can. Good luck to all of you! }}
