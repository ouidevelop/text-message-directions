#post{{Hi friends. I’m typing this from my old smart phone that I have stopped using ever since #tech-dumbphone{{I purchased a flip phone}}. About 3 months ago I purchased the Sunbeam F1 in the orchid model. This phone has:

• no email
• no internet
• no ability to send and receive videos
• a lackluster camera. 
• T9 keyboard 

It has everything a phone does need though, like:

• calculator
• notes
• texting
• alarm
• flashlight
• navigation 
• music if you download songs on it like you would an MP3 player 
• weather

The fastest route to ending your internet dependence, is investing in a flip phone. If you are a typical young gen z person like me, then you grew up with a plethora of different technology and spent too much time on the internet when you should have been playing outside or indulging in your hobbies. 

By getting rid of your smartphone you are completely eliminating any possibility of doom-scrolling or using the internet in a way that is not beneficial to you. When you have a smartphone there is always a chance you could give in and:

• Binge watch YouTube videos/Netflix
• Scroll on TikTok for hours
• Stare at your phone when in a social setting because you feel awkward
• Watch porn
• Compare your life to someone else on social media. 
• See ads and be tempted to buy something you don’t need
• Seeing violent or triggering content 
• Using phone right after waking up and just before going to bed, effecting sleep

With a flip-phone the chance of that is lowered to 0%

The advice of #tech-not-work{{“Delete the apps that distract you”}} or #tech-not-work{{“Set a time limit for the apps on your phone”}} is useless if you don’t have self control. I didn’t. I had to #tech-accept-problem{{admit that [[that I didn't have self control]] to myself in order to go on my no surf journey}}.

It is not all an issue of willpower though. Smart devices have countless distractions that are designed to keep you engaged for as long as possible. Tech companies raised your standards very high and made you believe that you NEED a phone with fancy and convenient features. In reality ALL of the generations before mine got by fine without the smartphones/ easily accessible internet. 

How do you get by without the internet anyway? I don’t. I’m not anti-internet. I have a laptop that I use occasionally for practical purposes like checking my bank accounts, paying my bills or looking up directions. I’m about using the internet in a healthy, practical way. It’s about being in control and not letting the internet control YOU. The internet itself is not bad- it’s the relationship that you have with it is bad. Having a flip-phone will simply limit your internet use that is wasteful and unnecessary. Instead I tend to:

• Read books for information 
• Look up directions beforehand at home
• Ask a friend to look something up for me if I’m out and about 
• Hear news from friends and family

How has having a flip-phone changed my life? The best way to answer this is that #ben-live-in-reality{{I now spend the majority of my time in reality and I occasionally delve into cyberspace}}. Just a few months ago, the opposite was true. #ben-being-present{{I feel more present now}}. Some other positives I have noticed are:

• #ben-more-time{{More free time}} to #other-activities-read{{read}}
• More free time to enjoy my hobbies
• #ben-better-connection{{Not distracted when with friends}}
• #ben-misc{{Time to rest my mind instead of reaching for my phone during mundane things}} like waiting in line/in an office/waiting to be picked up etc.
• #ben-less-anxiety{{Less stress}}
• #ben-feel-better{{Better mood}}
• #ben-outside-more{{Spending more time outside}}

How do people react to my flip phone? Isn’t that weird in these times? Most people surprisingly don’t care. If I do get a comment on it all of them are positive. Saying things like “That’s so cute and Y2K” or “I had one of those back in my day.” Many are intrigued with it and I have yet to be met with mockery. 

In conclusion I hope that this post has inspired you to make a change in your life. I wish you all luck on your no surf journey.}}
