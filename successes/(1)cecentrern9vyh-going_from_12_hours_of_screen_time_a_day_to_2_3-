This is just my phone screen time, but I just want to do a little celebration! My phone screen time has always been terrible, 7-8 hours was my normal. Then work from home happened along with other personal things and during that time I turned off the screen time function so I didn't notice until I turned it on again, and it was horrifying -- 12 hours a day. I spend half of my day on my phone, half of my day staring at a screen. I think seeing the number makes reality and #symp-horror{{horror}} set in for me.

Personally, #tech-delete{{deleting games app}} and #tech-grayscale{{turning on grey scale help me a lot}}. The grey scale still annoys me so much, but maybe that's the whole point because it makes scrolling very boring. Then there's also #tech-time-limits{{time limit that you can put on the social media apps}} -- I still keep my social media apps because it's how I connect with friends and family when I live so far away from them, but I don't want to spend my days scrolling #a-t-twitter{{Twitter}} or #a-t-facebook{{Facebook}} while waiting for them to respond to my message.

Then I also use the #tech-blocker-forest{{Forest app which blocks your phone for at most two hours at a time. In the beginning I can only do a 20 minute interval then gradually increasing it to stay longer and longer without looking at the phone}}. On the computer I use the extension #tech-blocker-stayfocusd{{StayFocusd and turn on the nuclear option to block social media during the time I know my families and friends wouldn't be online}}, so I have no excuse to go surf the net.

I also #tech-do-other-things{{need to fill my days which was previously preoccupied by scrolling with something else}}, so I added #other-activities-exercise{{exercising}}, #other-activities-read{{reading books}}, and #other-activities-learn{{learning new skills (currently studying bookkeeping}} and hoping to study Spanish one day) on the list. During this period, #tech-journaling{{journaling was very helpful to me}} because it keeps me on track (and I need to get back on it because not journaling makes me unmotivated to exercise).

Overall, I have to rely on a lot of strategies because no one individual things did it all, but again deleting game apps was a life-changing moment for me. It takes off at least 6 hours a day of screen time, and all the other things I do did the rest. I know for many people 2-3 hours a day on the phone is still a lot, but for me it's a huge improvement :)}}
