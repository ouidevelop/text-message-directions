1. #tech-blocker-screentime{{if you have the iPhone, use a screen time parental password}}. It’s in the settings. There’s many #a-t-youtube{{YouTube}} videos explaining how to do it and I find these app limiters are harder to bypass than android ones. Since I’m in college, I allow myself 30 minutes of screen time for social media and safari M-Th, Friday 3 hours and Sat-Sun 1 hour. I use the feature of preventing downloading new apps without the password. My dad has the password and honestly I don’t feel that tempted to ask him because it gets uncomfortable when I do lol. It’s awesome bc now I can keep my phone on me for calls, text messages and emails without the distraction of social media.
2. #tech-misc{{Get the kitchensafe}}. This is the method I started last year and I’m less reliant on it. I used to put my phone in the kitchensafe- a time locker safe that can go up to a week. It really does work. However, I do need to use my phone for calls and whatnot, but I think the kitchensafe is great when it’s at night and you don’t want the distraction of your phone before you sleep so you can just put it in there.
3. Laptop social media/website blockers are also great. I used to rely on 1focus but it rly slowed down my Mac. I now use #tech-blockers{{Focusme}} and it works just as well. My routine for college is to use a pomodoro blocker- 40 mins of social media website blocks with 5 minute breaks. After 3 pomodoros, I get a 10 minute break and the cycle repeats. Fridays are my off days and weekends I usually give myself 20 minute breaks after 3 pomodoros.
4. Read the book #book-how-to-break-up-with-your-phone{{“How to break up your phone”}}. I didn’t finish it but the beginning gives you a lot of statistics and reasons why you should keep a limit with your phone and I found it really effective.

I’m not saying I’m perfect, I still go through “relapses” with my addiction but I can confidently say I am way better than I was 2 years ago (where I spent my whole summer in my bed on the phone and only got up to use the bathroom and eat). Good luck and drop your methods as well :)}}
