#post{{After two years spending 8 hours surfing  each day I'm here. Kind of surreal. 

I also found out that stopping to watch #a-t-porn{{porn}} has great benefits for me #ben-less-disgusting-thoughts{{(all disgusting fantasies went away)}} and in addition to that #ben-more-fun{{I have a lot more fun}} #other-activities-learn{{studying}} and #other-activities-socializing{{spending time with friends}}. I dont plan to use the internet ever again without the rules I defined myself for safe usage.}}

#post{{Three days ago I had a slip of 20mins and because of that I take extra focus of spending zero seconds in the net mindless surfing. And yeah, I aced it so far!  

A quick tip by the way: as hard as it sounds instead of only planing to stay clean for 21 days to change your habit I highly recommend you to do a 90 days cold turkey because after these 21 days you will also encounter problems (you hear your parents fighting, you get a bad grade, you realize you have to cut out a friend, etc) and its very important to also master these moments. You have to relearn how to spend time with yourself alone and this cannot be learned in 21 days.  

#withdrawal-time{{But before it sounds too hard the first 10 days staying clean are by fare the hardest}} and after 21 days staying clean its kind of easy to extend your digital detox.}}




#title:{{I am 6 months clean :) &amp; Why you don’t loose something when you disconnect with the internet}} #permalink:/r/nosurf/comments/xc7hrq/i_am_6_months_clean_why_you_dont_loose_something/, #created:1662972094 

#post{{On the one hand I want to post this to celebrate it a bit and on the other hand to give you motivation.

Currently I don’t watch porn, don’t play #a-t-games{{video games}}, don’t use #a-t-instagram{{Insta}} for 6 months. I am a bit hardcore but I don’t watched one single youtube video for entertainment for 6 months (I only watch them to understand math problems). Despite 3 slips of around 5 hours I havnt googled unnecessarily stuff for 6 months. I check my phone twice a day for 5 minutes each times. I watch the news every second day for 10 minutes. I do watch around 2 movies a week. Because I am clean for so long I only have one small urge every day and now its very easy to stay clean. I don’t have one single youtube channel or one subreddit in my mind which I miss and would like to visit frequently.

Achievements:

\- #ben-productive{{I had the longest and most intense learning phase of my life (1.5 months)}} with the result that #ben-better-school{{I was under the top 4 percent of my Analysis exam where over 55 percent didn’t pass the exam}}. With passing that exam I have the worst exam of computer science behind me and the rest of the subjects are easy

\- I was tracking my learning phase very intensive so that I learn from my mistakes and have an easier and more effective learning phase next semester

\- in the other exam I had I got the best grade possible

\- #ben-better-attention{{I am able to concentrate and study for 8 hours a day in a row}}

\- #ben-better-social-life{{I reconnected with my friends and meet them on a regular basis}}

\- #ben-made-friends{{I made around 5 more friends though uni}}

\- I helped three other people successfully getting clean through being a sponsor for them and be an inspiration for them

\- #ben-feel-better{{I am in a way better mental state and had not a single bad day after I was 1 week clean (only some evenings were bad)}}

\- I have a lot more fun studying which I have never thought

\- #ben-better-worldview{{my worldview changed for the better: while surfing 6h a day I thought that nearly all people are unhappy but now I think that other people are happy too}}

\- because I don’t surf or watch youtube videos when studying is boring or exhausting I have a big advantage of my classmates because #ben-less-frustration{{I don’t get frustrated so often}} and my #ben-more-motivation{{motivation is higher}}

\- #other-activities-read{{I read around 21 books}} and 4 were in English which is very impressive because my native language is German ( I read around 50 pages every day)

\- I learned that I like doing sports

Habits I already build up:

\- writing a journal every day

\- stand up immediately after waking up

\- shower coldly

\- if I have to google something I do it after eating dinner

\- don’t crack my knuckles anymore (a habit I wanted to change for 2 years)

\- don’t pick my nose (a habit I wanted to change for 2 years)

\- learn flash cards every day

\- don’t rub my eyes

\- always wear my glasses

Habit I want to establish in this and the following month:

\- don’t pick my ears (a habit I also try to change for 2 years)

\- row every second day

\- don’t eat snacks in free time and change my nutrition

\- meditate every morning and evening

\- learn speedreading

\- check my smartphone at 11 am, 2 pm and 5pm

\- always wear my contact lens

\- use dental floss

I am working on building up one habit a week and helping more people getting clean because besides doing something good its such a wonderful feeling when they thank you for what you doing and how precious your help was to them :)

So everyone of you who thinks about what they will miss when they quit and if its really worth deleting your steam or youtube account keep in mind what you are capable doing when you are clean.

PS you are not alone. From time to time I will look into this subreddit and be a sponsor for someone who wants to get clean, I already tried it with three people and we were always successful after 3 weeks :)}}
