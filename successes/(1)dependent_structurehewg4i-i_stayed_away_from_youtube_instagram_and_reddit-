#post{{I was heavily into #a-t-youtube{{Youtube}} the whole of 2019 up until february (and for years before). I don't think I did anything else but always watch youtube or have it playing in the background. I would watch gaming streams for hours on end ( I don't even game lol) and anything and everything that was recommended.

I decided to give it all up cold turkey, along with the mindless browsing of #a-t-instagram{{instagram}} and #a-t-reddit{{reddit}}.

There were 2 lessons I've learnt since:

1. : which is why I used Youtube and social media as an escape. I had lost all my friends in 2019 and I was just filling a hole that was getting bigger every day. I decided to make some new friends and even though I still feel lonely, I don't want to go back to being an internet addict.
2. #ben-more-time{{I have time}}: All my excuses of me not reaching my goals or starting my dreams, all the excuses went out the window in March. #ben-more-confident{{I noticed that I do have the ability to build habits. My mindset changed from wishing for stuff to happen to how can I make this happen.}}

I'm not perfect but I'm really proud of myself.

If I can do it, everyone reading this can too. Staying off social media etc won't give you powers, but it is definitely going to give you a peace of mind and that's priceless.

Edit: I'm off again. I wish everyone the best :)}}
